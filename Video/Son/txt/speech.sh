Every year still thousands of people are injured or killed in accidents with cars, trucks and busses. 
Many of these people are pedestrians or cyclists. 
Pedestrian-vehicle crashes are responsible for more than a third of all traffic related fatalities and injuries worldwide. 
Many crashes involving pedestrians occur in urban areas where cars drive at relatively low speeds. 
The severity of injuries can be significantly reduced if appropriate countermeasures are taken by the driver and the pedestrian. 

One of the effectual measures against pedestrian-to-vehicle accidents is to make each of pedestrians and drivers find the others and recognize the risk from out of sight and with time to spare for avoidance of accidents. 

Smartphones have long become an omnipresent part of our life. 
Equipped with both a broadband internet connection and advanced GPS onboard sensors, the idea is to use them as mobile sensors for active safety systems that aim at protecting vulnerable road users such as pedestrians or cyclists


A pedestrian-to-vehicle communication system was developed by using a cellular phone and a car navigation system equipped with GPS and wireless communication function.
