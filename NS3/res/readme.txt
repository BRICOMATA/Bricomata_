berlin, malaga, paris, stockholm: SUMO maps imported from openstreetmap.
results: CSV data files with the results.
run/run.sh: Executes the simulations and generates the CSV data files.
run/sumo: SUMO traffic simulator Ver 0.19.0
run/traci: TraCI libs.

Notes:
 * exp: experts' solution of SUMO.
 * rs: Red Swarm.
 * IMPORTANT! In order to achieve exactly the same results as in our experiments you have to use SUMO 0.19.0 (included) on a Linux 64 bits machine.
 * If you want to use these maps in new versions of SUMO, please load the config files named [scenario].020.sumocfg.

SUMO is an open source, highly portable, microscopic and continuous road traffic simulation package designed to handle large road networks. 
It is mainly developed by employees of the Institute of Transportation Systems at the German Aerospace Center. 
SUMO is open source, licensed under the GPL. (http://sumo-sim.org/)
