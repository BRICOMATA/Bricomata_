Abstract—With dispersing of information on social networks both personally identiﬁable and general - comes the risk of these information falling into wrong hands. Users are burdened with setting privacy of multiple social networks, each with growing number of privacy settings. Exponential growth of applications (App) running on social networks have made privacy control increasingly difﬁcult. This necessitates Privacy as a service model, especially for social networks, to handle privacy across multiple applications and platforms. Privacy aware information dispersal involves knowing who is receiving what information of ours. Our proposed service employs a supervised learning model to assist user in spotting unintended audience for a post. Different from previous work, we combine both Tie-strength and Context of the information as features in learning. Our evaluation using several classiﬁcation techniques shows that the proposed method is effective and better than methods using either only Tie-strength or only Context of the information for classiﬁcation.
I. INTRODUCTION
Software as a service (SaaS), Infrastructure as a service (IaaS), Platform as a service (PaaS), Backend as a service (BaaS), Information technology management as a service (ITMaaS) are some of the services gaining ground. Privacy as a service is another such viable model. With our ever increasing online presence, Privacy as a service1 [10], [16] has drawn the attention of researchers and companies alike due to the urgency of the matter, especially in the context of privacy breaches heard every now and then.
Our online identity is being increasingly deﬁned by social networks identities. With social networking sites increasing popularity (1.23 billion monthly active users for Facebook2, 540 million active users on Google+ each month3), their use is becoming the norm and has necessitated identity management, access control and encryption mechanisms. Increased desire to become popular, aided by lazy and careless attitude towards privacy [3], [8], [31] has seen a marked increase in disclosure of personal information and opinions online, leading to privacy being at the receiving end.
Examples of over-sharing on social networks, leading to being sacked from jobs4, irreversible damage to personal relations5 are surfacing frequently. Embarrassing situations,

Blackmailing, Identity theft are some of the troublesome offshoots of information reaching more than the intended audience [8], [23].
Problem is not so much in disclosing information on social networks, but, has much to do with who the intended audience are. Finding the intended audience can be seen as privacyaware group creation problem.
Current social networks recommend to pre-classify friends into groups and to use these groups for communication. Available social network features like Circles from Google+6, pre-deﬁned group (Lists in Facebook terminology) based communication from Facebook leave the responsibility of Circles and group creation on users, which is not desirable. Smartlists7 from Facebook try to answer this shortcoming by automatic creation of lists based on common features, social graph or inferred information and these groups can be edited by the user for correctness. But, they are shown to be ineffective due to being rigid, noisy and problematic in managing security [11]. Hence, pre-deﬁned groups, Circles or Smartlists may not be sufﬁcient to answer all the information sharing needs.
Research in this regard has shown a need for in-context, on-demand group creation [1] as willingness to share varies not only on content recipients but also on content itself [21]. The underlying contexts of friendship are an important indicator of what information user and his friend share. Information, belonging to one context, may be appropriate to a close friend (eg., Friends can be added to a close friends list in Facebook). Given another piece of information belonging to a different context, may not be suitable for the same close friend as they may not share the context of next information. Here, the deﬁnition of close friend is relative to the contexts they share in friendship. Hence, it is important that the context of the information posted should be shared by recipients of the information. Clearly, there is a need to disperse information with enough weightage given to context of information and the underlying contexts of friendship.
All friends who share a context may not share the same intensity of friendship. Sharing of context attributes do not warrant information to be shared with all of them. A neighbor, school friend, colleague may share certain context deﬁning attributes (eg., location). But, they may be mere acquaintance rather than a friend. Social network treats all connections

as friends and since contexts shared between users, cannot differentiate a friend from an acquaintance, there is a need for a measure, of friendship. Tie-strength, in social networks, determines the strength of a friendship through measuring the similarity between their proﬁle items and communication [6], [29], [32].
Making use of both Context of information and Tiestrength, this paper proposes a service-oriented supervised learning model to assist user in determining the right target audience for each post about to be posted. Privacy aware information dispersal involves assisting user in understanding, from among his friends, who match the learnt model and who do not. The service considers proﬁle similarity and communication intensity and recency, used in tie-strength determination, as features that are used in supervised learning. The privacy service solicits user response in identifying the context deﬁning attributes of information about to be posted as the user is the best judge in identifying the underlying context of the information. Here, Context is a composite attribute made up of one or more context deﬁning attributes.
Our contributions can be summarized as follows:
• A new approach to privacy aware information dispersing, utilising machine learning on user data for classiﬁcation.
• To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst attempt in using Context and Tie-strength together in determining the intended audience of a post.
• An evaluation of the effectiveness of the proposed method against classiﬁcation based on Tie-strength alone or classiﬁcation based on Context alone.
The rest of the paper is organised as follows. We compare our work to the existing work in section II, in section III, we explain the background and motivation to our model. Details of the proposed model, along with framework and service implementation details are given in section IV. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model using Facebook dataset in section V. Section VI concludes and point out some of the directions for future work.
II. RELATED WORK
Our work on assisting user in identifying the intended audience is an amalgamation of many research interests. Setting visibility to proﬁle items, community extraction, tie-strength determination and Social Identity Management (SIdM) are the main, orthogonal, research interests.
Due to the lack of clear visualizations’ availability in social networks, that map to the mental model of users, privacy wizards [4], [17] have been proposed. These wizards assist user in setting visibility to proﬁle items, but, there is an equal need to assist user in determining the right target audience for a post. On the other hand, [15] consider proﬁle items in determining the privacy score. Even though privacy scoring helps user in his awareness of the risks involved in sharing information with other user, it does not hold his hands in deﬁning a policy for sharing.
Community extraction and clustering have been proposed as ways to create groups for a user. Community extraction

using network graph has been extensively studied by [5], [19], [20] and has been particularly tested in social networks community detection in [11]. Jones et. al [11] try to answer the common criterias considered by users while creating groups through a survey of Facebook users. Clustering algorithm SCAN [30] was used to group users and test how it fared when compared to user created groups. The results show that the manually created groups overlap with automatically created groups using the clustering algorithm by 44.83%, which is very low and impractical for real-life applications.
Gilbert and Karahalios’s [6] studied tie-strength as being dyadic in nature and classiﬁed strengths in social networks as either strong or weak. Statistical modelling considering linear combination of predictive variables, 67 of them, is used in determining whether a tie is strong or weak. This supervised method considers tie strength as a binary prediction. Xiang et al [29] study tie-strength to be spanning the whole spectrum from weak tie to strong tie. They propose a latent variable model that considers proﬁle features as discriminative and communication as generative in nature, in determining tiestrength.
Social Identity Management (SIdM) and context-aware, social sphere based audience segregation provide a new paradigm in achieving privacy in a socially networked world as well as a way of presenting and maintaining a consistent selfimage as appropriate to the audience. User’s social sphere could be manually segregated by the user to create different contexts, social spheres or groups of segregated audience. Van den Berg et. al [25] have proposed Clique a privacy preserving social network site. Manual audience segregation again rests the task of creating groups on user, which is not desirable. SIdM, as proposed by [22] gives an alternative way of achieving privacy by decoupling the burden of social identity management (SIdM) from social network provider, to achieve contextually segregated audience. SIdM, provides an alternative way of achieving privacy in an ideal setting, but does not answer the burning question of how to enhance privacy in the already popular social networks like Facebook, Google+, Myspace and others.
Regroup [1] is a Facebook application developed to assist user in creating groups on-demand, thereby avoiding embarrassing oversharing. As the user keeps on adding friends to the group being created, active machine learning is employed to learn the shared features and bring up the best matches to the top of the suggestion list. The research question being addressed by Regroup is same as being addressed by this paper. Finding the intended audience can be seen as privacy-aware group creation problem. They propose to use features shared between friends to identify the right set of target audience for a post, whereas we propose to use only those shared features that can deﬁne the context of post. Kahanda and Neville [12] in their work on prediction of link strength, use transactional data in ﬁnding if a link or tie is strong or weak. They group the obtained attributes into features to perform the classiﬁcation using supervised learning. They consider only proﬁle and communication characteristics and do not use context in their classiﬁcation.

III. BACKGROUND
A. Need for the proposed model
The central motivation to using social networks as noted by Tufekci [24] is being seen by those we wish to be seen by. In real life, we give out information based on our audience, sometimes withholding information when we are in the company of in-appropriate audience with respect to the information. But, due to the current social network setting, all social sphere’s or contexts collapse, ﬂattening out multiple distinct audiences into one singular group of recipients forcing user’s to ﬁnd alternative ways to manage a large and diverse set of connections [26]. Consider a common sharing scenario as in Example 1.
Example 1: Ana would like to share some pictures of her best friend Sara’s wedding, with her friends. She would like to restrict it to a) Only close friends that are common to Sara and her b) Among the close friends to those who were invited and attended. The available way in current social network setting is to select people one by one or to create a group, manually adding people into it and use this group to send photos.
Creating group for every such occasion and sharing requirement is not only cumbersome but difﬁcult to manage. Instead, with our model, information can be sent to only those friends who have a high tie-strength (close friends) along with satisfying the condition that they were invited for the wedding, the context.
Since, social networks consider all friendships equal and call them as friends, by using tie-strength, friends could be differentiated based on the tie-strength they share with the user. But, tie-strength alone cannot differentiate people from different social sphere’s and hence basing information dispersal only on tie-strength will lead to unintended people included as target audience.
In Example 1, Ana would like to distribute photos to her close friends (high tie-strength). But, this alone may not be enough as she wants to send it only to those close friends who attended the wedding (context: Facebook invite as a context and as a source of context information). Hence, context is essential along with tie-strength. Considering sending wedding photos to all those invited by Sara (context: Facebook invite) may not be desirable too as there may be people who are just Ana’s acquaintances along with her close friends. Hence, context alone will not be sufﬁcient.

Context of information about to be posted is a rich source of metadata about the actual information itself. Context, here is, a composite attribute. The attributes that deﬁne a context are varied. Attributes of context can be content of the post, event, geographic location of the post, geographic location of the content, language, relationship, datetime. By considering the relevant context attributes to each post and ﬁnding the friends who have a high context attribute similarity, can be a real distinguisher of intended audience for a post. Social circles can be identiﬁed by these context deﬁning attributes. Hence, we use social circles and context inter-changeably in this paper. The requirement here is not to suggest all the friends who need to be added, but, to highlight those from the selected recipients list who do not match the rest in tie-strength and context.
Table 1 gives two scenarios extracted from the Facebook dataset used in the experiments, explained later in section V. Table contains information about two posts. It is notable that in both the examples, and many such real life sharing scenarios, only tie-strength or only context based information dissemination does not sufﬁce. This requisites users to manually select users to whom they would like to share information. Evidently, to answer such sharing needs, there is a need for the Proposed model which makes use of both tie-strength and context. We omit the explanation of examples 2 and 3 in view of space.
B. Need for Privacy as a service
Understanding and changing privacy settings on social networking site places signiﬁcant cognitive burden on users, which pushes them to accept the default settings available. With the use of multiple social networking sites, users are forced to set privacy in each site separately. Privacy settings are manually selected for individual user or groups. With differing privacy options across multiple sites with multiple ways of setting privacy, user is laden with the responsibility of setting privacy uniformly across applications. Applications (Apps) development and consumption among social network users is growing. This brings to the fore, problem of controlling privacy across all apps, by the social networks and users alike. Privacy as a service has advantages over privacy incorporated individually into each social network.
IV. PROPOSED MODEL
The proposed Privacy as a service employs a supervised learning model using labelled examples of intended audience. Different from previous work, we propose to use both context

458

of information and tie-strength between user and his friends (for the rest of this paper, user means the social network user who wants to publish a post and friends are the user’s friends in that social network) as features in learning, for each usercontext pair. Friends are classiﬁed into intended audience based on the learnt model.

A. Preliminaries
Tie-strength features: The central concept of tie-strength is homophily [18]. Principle of homophily hypothesizes that people form ties with those people who have similar interests and characteristics to theirs, with a stronger tie being formed indicating a higher similarity [7]. We propose to ﬁnd similarity in proﬁle elements of a social network user along with utilising the communication characteristics. Proﬁle similarity and communication characteristics have been shown to be good indicators of tie-strength [6], [29] and have been used to derive tie-strength value. We propose to use proﬁle similarity and communication characteristics as features in learning. Our aim is to learn a predictive model of tie-strength using labeled training data with predictions of strong tie or weak tie as the expected outcome.

Events Groups Mutual Friends Likes
Written on wall - one year Other way round - one year
Tagged together in a post/photo - one year
Written on wall - Till date Other way round - Till date
Tagged together in a post/photo - Till date

Proﬁle similarity and communication have been divided into features as shown in Table 1. Friends are scored based on what percentage of their proﬁle matches the user. Single valued social network items, like, religious and political views, family are scored as boolean match (1/0), whereas multi-valued items, like, mutual friends, are calculated as percentage of match. Proﬁle items are grouped together meaningfully to capture the common circumstances of user and his friends. The values of each feature is calculated as the summation of the individual items.
General proﬁle similarity gives the similarities shared in proﬁle items of a user and his friend and Group proﬁle similarity scores the mutual likes and groups they share along with common events and friends. Wall posts captures posts on friend’s wall or post on user’s wall by friend. Stronger ties

typically use multiple, redundant channels to communicate, as suggested by media multiplexity [9]. Therefore, ofﬂine interaction would lead to stronger ties online. Wall Posts and Tagging, together account for the Communication strength feature. The recency of communication has been accounted for by dividing the communication into Last year communication and Till date communication features used in learning.
Context features: Context similarity is measured based on how many context deﬁning attributes are common between friend’s context attributes and the post’s context attributes. Intended audience determination service requires user to input information about to be posted (Post) and choose context typecontent type pairs from among the choices provided using the pre-learnt model. User would then choose attributes, from among the available attributes list. This attribute list is the items that can be extracted from social network, in our study from Facebook, to deﬁne a Context. It is notable that the model will function in the absence of any inputs from user, by using only the tie-strength features, albeit being less functional.
Context is made up of composite attribute set. A standard set of pre-learnt attributes or user provided attribute information can be used to denote the context of the information about to be posted. In this study, the users chose to provide the attribute information from among the proﬁle items. These items were scored as 1 if the user and his friends values matched, 0 otherwise. The attribute values, summed together make up the Speciﬁc context similarity, another feature in learning.
Table 3 gives examples of context type, content type, attributes and corresponding proﬁle information or communication information from social network that could be used to measure the similarity.
B. Framework
The framework to classify users into intended audience and unintended audience for each post consists of three main parts:
User input: User inputs the post, for which the intended audience are to be determined. The service expects user to select the context type-content type and provide context deﬁning attributes. The service could assist user by providing example scenarios and choices to choose, from the pre-learnt model. Only input compulsory is Post and all other inputs are optional.
Feature extraction: For each user, his friends are extracted and their feature scores calcualted. The scores are calculated by matching all the information of user and his friend for each item in social network, with score being, the percentage of matching information. As each additional friend is added, features are extracted and feature scores stored. Feature extraction is triggered with each additional post from the user or each addition of friend or both, as set by the user. Feature extraction could also be triggered by changing of items’ values (eg., adding a new work company name), although such changes are not done very often.
Learning and classiﬁcation: Positive samples are derived from sent friends list and those who have not received the post form the negative samples for the context. Classiﬁcation techniques are used to learn the classiﬁcation for the ﬁrst time,

from user posts. Subsequently, it could be triggered everytime the user posts a new post or as and when triggered by the user. User could choose to use only tie-strength feature set (by providing only post as user input) or all features for learning and classiﬁcation.
User starts by choosing friends from a set of pre-deﬁned groups or selects everyone of his friends as the intended audience for the post. Service is invoked before posting this new information. The learnt model is then utilised to suggest friends who do not match the learnt model and need to be reviewed as possible unintended audience, by the user, before posting.

D. Service Implementation
This section brieﬂy describes the implementation of Privacy service. The architecture diagram is as shown in Figure 1. Privacy as a service accepts user input and provides intended audience recommendations based on a model learnt speciﬁc to that user. Privacy service can work with multiple social

Fig. 1. Service Architecture
Control ﬂow diagram of the implementation of Privacy service in social networks is shown in Figure 2. User interaction with the service is kept simple and to a minimal as seen from the Control ﬂow diagram. This is so as to reduce cognitive burden on the user. User is also assisted in choosing the attributes with recommendations for context type-content type selected. By giving an option to select ALL for probable friends to whom the user might want to send the post, the service takes control in choosing the intended audience. It is notable that, user will choose the ﬁnal intended audience list and Privacy service only acts as a recommender basing its recommendations on the learned model, speciﬁc to each user.
The critical component of the service is learning from user data. The accuracy of predictions from learned model depends on the nature of data and importantly, on the classiﬁcation techniques involved. With the use of both basic and advanced techniques we wanted to conﬁrm the effectiveness of the features selected for classiﬁcation. We ﬁrst introduce two basic techniques (Naive Bayes, k-NN) that are computationally inexpensive. Social networks data is often of high variance with missing data and incomplete data, a common occurance. We introduce two techniques (LMNN, GB-LMNN) that are,

460

Fig. 2. Control Flow diagram of Privacy service

although computationally expensive than the basic techniques, tolerant towards variance, imbalance and missing data. We compare the effectiveness of each method against the proposed model in experiments section.

1) Naive Bayes: Naive Bayes classiﬁcation [14] is a prob-

abilistic classiﬁer with assumption of independence between

features. The classiﬁer combines the Naive Bayes probability

model with a decision rule to pick the most probable outcome,

that is known as maximum a posteriori or MAP decision rule.

Applying, Naive Bayes classiﬁer, is thus given as in (Equation

[1]) -
n

argmaxO p(O ) p(Fj|O )

(1)

j=1

where Fj = {GP sim, GrP sim, Commsim, SCtsim } and p(Fj|O ) is the likelihood of a friend with feature values from
set Fj being a member of O , the intended audience class.

2) k-Nearest Neighbors: k-Nearest Neighbors [2] or k-NN is a non-parametric technique which is used for classiﬁcation. In this technique, k closest neighbours to each input is found and the input is classiﬁed based on the majority vote of its nearest neighbors. In this paper, Mahalonobis metric is used to calculate the distance of sample which is deﬁned as

d(x, y) = (x − y)T M (x − y)

(2)

where M is the covariance matrix of vectors x and y.

3) Large Margin Nearest Neighbour (LMNN): The LMNN objective is twofold [28]: decreasing the distance of each data point from its target neighbors by pulling the target neighbors closer to data point (Equation [3]). Target neighbors of each data point are the closest instances to it with the same class label as the data point.

ξpull(L) =

L(Xi − Xj ) 2

(3)

ji

The second goal is, increasing the distance of each data point and its imposters by pushing the imposters further apart. The imposters are instances with different class labels where their distances are less than target neighbours of the data point. The pushing function is deﬁned as follows (Equation [4]):

ξpush(L) =

(1 − yil)[1+ L(Xi − Xj) 2

i,j i l

(4)

− L(Xi − Xl) 2]+

These two functions are combined to introduce loss function of LMNN (Equation [5]).

ξ(L) = (1 − μ)ξpull(L) + μξpush(L)

(5)

Where μ ∈ [0, 1] is a weighting parameter to balance the objectives.

4) Gradient Boosting Large Margin Nearest Neighbour (GB-LMNN): Since LMNN is unable to ﬁnd non-linear similarities between data points, GB-LMNN was proposed [13], in which LMNN is generalized to a non-linear transformation φ, where combination of gradient boosted regression trees is applied to ﬁnd a right form of φ (Equation [6]).

φ = φ0 + α (ht)

V. EXPERIMENTS
This section evaluates the effectiveness of the proposed model in ﬁnding the appropriate target audience for information to be posted in Facebook. The proposed service has been tested by using the four classiﬁcation techniques described in the previous section. These classiﬁcation techniques are used to classify user’s friends (denoted by O) to either being the right target audience (denoted by O ) or as unintended audience (denoted by O − O ). We collected the proﬁle items and communication data from selected friends of the user making sure both classes O and O − O were represented.
Proposed model has been tested with one of the most popular social network, Facebook. Model would work on other popular social networks too, as they contan similar user proﬁle and communication information. LinkedIn provides features such as school, company, geographic region, industry, job area, common groups and connections that could be used to ﬁnd the proﬁle similarity with establishing a connection, writing a recommendation, proﬁle viewing useful for communication similarity. Google+ provides proﬁle information in the form of education, occupation and employment information, places lived, skills, common events and communities for proﬁle similarity and messages, tagging can be considered for communication similarity.

A. Evaluation
For evaluation, we collected proﬁle similarity, communication and speciﬁc proﬁle similarities of 230 pairs of Facebook users, with each pair consisting a user and his friend. 230 users represent 6 different nationalities. On an average, users have been friends since 23 months. Posts were collected for a duration of 4 months starting from October 2013 till January 2014. A total of 6 contexts were identiﬁed from a set of 106 posts. The results of 6 posts, each representing a unique context and sharing pattern have been discussed in the results section.
The similarity values of General and Group proﬁle similarity, Last year and Till date communication similarity values are obtained as continuous data. The contexts of post, varied from being too sensitive content type to general information. The posts used in experimental evaluation had on an average 3 context deﬁning attributes that could be extracted. We held out 20% of records as test and used 80% to learn the model. Accuracy values are obtained by averaging over 100 runs. Example context deﬁning attributes collected during the experiments have been listed in the Table 4.

Table 5 gives a snippet of the records with values for various attributes. The records indicate the importance of selected features in identifying the right target audience. In particular, classiﬁcation ’Yes’ indicates, right target audience. Record 1 has high Group proﬁle similarity, though it lacks communication. This is a classic case of a friend being just observer in social network communication with the user. Records 2, 3, and 5 are intended audience, owing to them having a high communication similarity value. All ’Yes’ records also have Speciﬁc context similarity value > 0 (tie-strength + context). All ’No’ classiﬁcations, have Speciﬁc context similarity value as 0 (no context similarity) other than record 11 . Record 11 is very low in proﬁle similarity and communication feature values and hence classiﬁed ’No’, even though it has high Speciﬁc context similarity (low tie-strength, high context similarity).
B. Results and discussion
Using Naive Bayes, k-NN, LMNN, GB-LMNN, user’s friends were classiﬁed as belonging to intended audience or unintended audience. The results are as shown in Table 6. The table shows the comparison of accuracy of the proposed model as compared with classiﬁcation on only Tie-strength and only Context.

• Regardless of the chosen classiﬁcation method, the proposed model works better than classiﬁcation based on only tie-strength features or only context features.
• LMNN and GB-LMNN give better result due to their tolerance towards data variance.
• GB-LMNN performs the best.
Post 1,2,4,5: Accuracy supports the proposed method. In all cases, the proposed method performs better than classiﬁcation based on tie-strength or context alone.
Post 3: Jones et al. [11] work identiﬁes group creation, and further postings to the group, being inﬂuenced by tiestrength. In post 3, classiﬁcation based on the proposed method performs no better than classiﬁcation based on tie-strength alone. Sending a post to all best friends, is a notable example.
Post 6: In this post, we can observe that proﬁle similarity or communication is not an inﬂuencing factor in determining the intended audience. GB-LMNN accuracy (93.84%) is comparable to classiﬁcation based on context alone (96%). Work on group creation in social networks [1], [11] have shown that social circles is a major factor in the creation of groups and in some-cases, social circle alone is the deﬁning criteria. There are also situations where no suitable context deﬁning attributes can be mapped to social network items. In Post 6, the situation was later; we could not identify a suitable attribute able to identify the context of information in post. Hence, we made use of Received item belonging to context, previously as an attribute. The results clearly show this is a very sensitive attribute in identifying the classes correctly. It is notable that Received item belonging to context, previously can be used, when there is a previous occurance that can be fed for learning.

VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
We have proposed Privacy as a service model to assist user in choosing the intended audience for a post in social networks. The service uses tie-strength and context similarity as features in supervised learning. The proposed service, solicits input from user in the form of actual information to be posted, attributes, optionally accepting additional new context deﬁning attributes. Comprehensive experiments prove that our model provides acceptable accuracy in most cases and can work even in the absence of context attributes altogether. The proposed privacy service can assist in identifying friends who do not belong to the intended audience. Our ongoing work includes addressing the problem of blind spots [27] in social network analysis and deriving a learning algorithm for friend addition or post updates from new contexts.
