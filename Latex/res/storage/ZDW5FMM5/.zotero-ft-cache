ABSTRACT
We describe survey results from a representative sample of 1,075 U.S. social network users who use Facebook as their primary network. Our results show a strong association between low engagement and privacy concern. Speciﬁcally, users who report concerns around sharing control, comprehension of sharing practices or general Facebook privacy concern, also report consistently less time spent as well as less (self-reported) posting, commenting and “Like”ing of content. The limited evidence of other signiﬁcant diﬀerences between engaged users and others suggests that privacyrelated concerns may be an important gate to engagement. Indeed, privacy concern and network size are the only malleable attributes that we ﬁnd to have signiﬁcant association with engagement. We manually categorize the privacy concerns ﬁnding that many are nonspeciﬁc and not associated with negative personal experiences. Finally, we identify some education and utility issues associated with low social network activity, suggesting avenues for increasing engagement amongst current users.

1. INTRODUCTION
The challenges of privacy in social networks are well-known. Surveys help us gauge the rate of privacy concern by demographic segments (e.g. [7, 13]) and deep qualitative and

quantitative research captures the negative privacy experiences (e.g. [30]) and nuanced privacy attitudes (e.g. [4]) of users. Others approach social network privacy from the behavioral side, ﬁnding signiﬁcant relationships between privacyrelated actions (e.g. [25]).
Less is understood about the link between the two: privacy concern and experience and the behaviors of the users reporting concerns. Clearly, each is very diﬃcult to measure through self-report as we do here. Privacy concern is subject to self-report bias and hence, concern measurement is an active area of research (e.g. [17]). In addition, the challenges of measuring behavior through self-report are well-known (e.g. [29, 9]). We attempt to moderate measurement bias by asking about several diﬀerent aspects of privacy (e.g. comprehension, control, perception of others) and argue that even the perception on the part of a user that they are less engaged is important and suggests there is room for improvement in the user’s experience with the service.
Our contribution toward understanding this link is a survey of 1, 363 users selected randomly from a representative panel of social network users residing in the U. S. [11]. Because our sample is dominated by 1, 075 users who regard Facebook as their primary social network, we focus on this subset, thus controlling for answer variations due to social network diﬀerences. However, we emphasize the survey questions are not speciﬁc to Facebook and the ﬁndings may apply to other networks.
We consider both overall social network privacy concern and aspects of concern related to transparency and control, speciﬁcally, comprehension of information sharing in the network, control over information sharing in the network, and sharing practices of the user in relation to their friends in the network (all survey questions are in the Appendix). We ﬁnd that each aspect of privacy concern is strongly associated with self-reported engagement across several measures, including visit frequency, comment frequency and frequency of “Like”ing content. Speciﬁcally, users who report higher concern are less engaged. Similarly, users who perceive their friends as sharing more personal information are less engaged (an interesting counterpart to [5] in which sharing by friends increases engagement). In contrast, those who report more control and comprehension over sharing of their information in the network, are more engaged.1
1For ease of exposition, we do not repeat the term “report” throughout this paper. That is, for example, we say “users are concerned” as shorthand for “users report to be concerned”.

Importantly, these relationships with engagement generally persist when we control for time spent on the network. For example, 21% of the 379 moderately concerned users who visit a few times a week or more never post personal photos, versus 12% of the 426 slightly concerned users who visit a few times a week or more.
In addition, we ﬁnd few demographic diﬀerences between high engagement and low engagement users. Privacy concern and network size (with low engagement-users tending to have smaller networks) are the main signiﬁcant diﬀerences, suggesting privacy is an important hurdle to social network engagement.
One opportunity for surmounting the privacy hurdle appears to be education. In some contexts, privacy-concerned users may not be aware of features related to their concerns. For example, more than 40% of users reporting little control over the sharing of their information in the network, do not limit the visibility of any of the proﬁle ﬁelds surveyed (picture, birth date, phone number, home address, residence city, email address, gender, relationship status, and interests/hobbies). Since we ﬁnd privacy-concerned users are less engaged, this lack of use of visibility controls is compatible with the ﬁnding of boyd-Hargittai [4] that engaged users are more likely to adjust privacy settings.
In addition, we ﬁnd evidence of the importance of “servicesanctioned” controls. Work-arounds may serve the immediate privacy goal, but do not contribute signiﬁcantly to perceptions of control. As an example, those who use nicknames or fake names in Facebook do not report signiﬁcantly more control over the sharing of their information in the network, and on average they report less control, than other users.
1.1 Related work
There are a number of research themes related to our survey. The foundational underpinnings to privacy provided by Westin (e.g. [12]) and Altman (e.g. [2]) inform our goal of understanding the nature of reported social network privacy concern both in terms of issues to address and survey design. In addition, there have been numerous overlapping surveys (e.g. the Pew Internet series) and novel approaches to modeling social network privacy. We highlight some of the most related eﬀorts in each theme in the following.
Models of privacy in social networks. Our work is perhaps closest to eﬀorts to model privacy-related behaviors and attitudes toward understanding cause and eﬀect. We highlight several contributions that are closely related to ours; each examines privacy settings and their connection to attitudes and behaviors.
Limiting visibility of proﬁles is found to be a boundary management tool for weak ties in [26]. Building on this [25] ﬁnds that users who report to have customized privacy settings tend to disclose more and users who have read more of a site’s privacy policy tend to disclose less.
Privacy settings modiﬁcations are used as a proxy for privacy concern in [4]. boyd and Hargittai [4] provide a longitudinal study of privacy practices and attitudes of teenagers (speciﬁcally, 18-19 year olds). They ﬁnd signiﬁcant behavioral evidence of privacy concern in this age group, in contrast to popular opinion, and ﬁnd that engaged users are more likely to change privacy settings. Homophily-like drivers for privacy settings modiﬁcations are found in [14] in addition to gender-based diﬀerences for privacy settings (with women limiting proﬁle visibility more).

Acquisti and Gross [1] ﬁnd discrepancies between reported privacy concerns and privacy-related behaviors amongst Facebook users.
In contrast to each of these, we focus more on associations between reported concerns and broad engagement metrics, as our goal is to understand the users who report privacy and how they are interacting with the social network service in both privacy and non-privacy related ways. We show these users have consistently low engagement with the system, and do not diﬀer from engaged users in many other respects, thus suggesting that addressing privacy concern may be necessary to activity.
Our work is perhaps closest to eﬀorts to predict privacy (e.g. [31]) however in contrast to previous work we focus speciﬁcally on social network privacy and look at several (related) aspects of social network privacy concern.
Privacy Surveys. A number of very valuable surveys related to social networks and privacy already exist (e.g. [13, 15, 21, 28]. These surveys gauge percentages of speciﬁc social network behaviors, user attributes and attitudes. Our survey diﬀers from these in that we try to understand associations between attitudes and behaviors/attributes; that is, we look at what actions, attributes and beliefs are associated with f report privacy concerns to better understand the nature of those concerns.
That said, it is worth summarizing how our percentages compare with the most closely related numbers in existing surveys. Our ﬁndings are consistent with many of the Pew Internet surveys. In particular, [13] ﬁnds that 58% of social network users have restricted access to their entire proﬁle and [15] ﬁnds that 58% of social network users have restricted access to parts of their proﬁle. We ﬁnd that the same percentage of Facebook users have restricted access to at least one proﬁle ﬁeld.
Also, [13] reports that 17% of users have more than one account on a social networking site, and we ﬁnd that 10% of Facebook users have more than one account; we do not ﬁnd

in [15], in particular, 11% of SNS users have posted content they regret. We ﬁnd that 6% of Facebook users have posted to a wider audience than intended, with no significant diﬀerences by gender or age. In addition, [21] looks at negative outcomes from social network use, and reports that 26% have experience “bad outcomes”. We look at the narrower question of bad outcomes due to proﬁle ﬁelds and ﬁnd lower numbers overall; the percentages are less than 10% with the exception of negative experiences from phone number (.17%), home address (16%) and email (12%).

Privacy Theory. Starting with the work of Alan Westin [12] (and continuing more recently with Palen-Dourish [19] and Margulis [16] among others) there has been a substantial eﬀort to characterize, or categorize, users according to their privacy concerns. Irwin Altman [2] also made signiﬁcant contibutions by initiating a theory of privacy processes, with a focus on social interactions. Our work overlaps with these lines of research in that we are studying speciﬁc aspects of privacy (overall concerns, control and sharing) and how they are connected to diﬀerence behaviors and attributes, in the speciﬁc context of social networking and Facebook. We are interested in more complete characterizations of users who report privacy concerns in the social network domain.
Overview. This paper is organized as follows. We begin in Section 2 with a discussion of our methodology. Section 3 summarizes the survey results, describes our content analysis and presents signiﬁcant associations between survey variables. We discuss our results and conclude in Section 4. Survey questions are in the appendix.
2. METHODOLOGY
2.1 Survey
In order to examine attitudes regarding privacy and social networks, we rely on survey methodology deployed by Knowledge Networks (KN). KN uses a probability-based

Figure 1: Degree of understanding and control of how information is shared to other Facebook users as a percentage of the responding participants (1060 for Q20 and 1061 for Q21). Diﬀerences are signiﬁcant at the .01 level.
We look at associations with self-reported Facebook privacy concern (Q22) and Internet privacy concern (Q22a) as well as 3 questions related to information transparency and control: control over information sharing within Facebook (Q20), sharing of personal information in Facebook (Q19), and comprehension of information sharing in Facebook (Q21). The direct privacy questions, Q22 and Q22a, were coded so that higher levels of concern correspond to larger integers. Similarly, the coded numbers increase with higher levels of comprehension in Q22, higher levels of control in Q20, and higher levels of sharing in Q19.
The complete survey is in the appendix, but we repeat these questions here since they are key to the analysis:
• (Q22) How do you feel about your privacy with regard to Facebook?
– Not at all concerned – Slightly concerned – Moderately concerned – Very concerned – Extremely concerned
• (Q22a) How do you feel about your privacy with regard to the Internet overall?
– Same answer options as Q22
• (Q20) To what degree do you feel you can control how your information is shared with other Facebook users?
– Cannot control at all – Can control a little – Can control a moderate amount – Can control a lot

3

– Can control a great deal
• (Q19) Compared to the rest of the people in my network, I share personal information:
– Much less – Somewhat less – About as much – Somewhat more – Much more
• (Q21) How well do you understand what information about you is shared with other Facebook users?
– Don’t understand at all – Understand slightly – Understand moderately well – Understand very well – Understand extremely well
The aspects of privacy represented by these questions are intuitively related, for example, as feelings of control and comprehension increase one would expect overall privacy concern to decrease. We ﬁnd that this is the case; all the correlations are provided in Table 2.
2.2 Content Analysis
To broadly gather online privacy concerns, our survey includes two open-ended text questions [Q23: “What are your main privacy concerns online?”, Q24: “What potential negative consequences are there from the concerns you mentioned in your answers to question Q23?”]. This method avoids aiding or biasing respondents with predetermined answer choices, and generates top-of-mind, salient responses. Two questions are used in order to both invite top of mind online privacy concerns and probe the speciﬁc consequences stemming from the reported concerns. Concerns and consequences together provide a better understanding of how respondents reason through the logical ramiﬁcations of their privacy concerns and how their expressed fears might evolve when urged to reﬂect on the consequences.
We rely on hand-coded content analysis to complement our quantitative analysis. The content analysis utilizes a grounded theory approach [23] to develop common themes in the open response. Our codes reﬂect the most speciﬁc level of comment provided by each respondent, without assuming any details that are not explicitly mentioned. For example, when a respondent lists identity theft in their answer to [Q23: “What is your main privacy concern online”], we do not presume the probable repercussion of ﬁnancial loss unless it is speciﬁcally mentioned by the respondent. Similarly, when a respondent voices concerns about access to their personal information, we code it as “Access to Personal Data”, while we reserve the “Misuse of Personal Data” coding for responses that mention this particular outcome. After coding the responses as narrowly as possible, we cluster the categories and identify a theme for each cluster. We utilize a second coder to measure agreement. The intercoder agreement rate is 71.4%. Note that in cases of disagreement, the raters coding choices were not far apart (i.e. diﬀerent subcategories within the same broader category) and a consensus was reached after discussion.

Our survey begins with questions regarding user engagement on Facebook, including how often they engage in certain activities. Table 3 shows that most respondents report a high level of Facebook use (61% visit at least once a day). They also report low levels of content creation via posts, photos and comments. This conﬁrms the prevalence of ‘lurker’ style consumption patterns in online communities [18].
We also focus on privacy concern and understanding. As a starting point, we ask how often users change their account security or privacy settings. Most respondents (72.9%) report changing their settings at least once, but these changes appear to occur sparingly (45% reported making a change less than once a month).
Facebook haring habits vary by information type. As Table 4 shows, the more personal the information gets (e.g., home address), the lower the probability of being shared. Interestingly, very few users provide fake information instead.
Perception of other’s personal information sharing relative to a user’s own, also varies. 44.8% report sharing much less, 28.5% report sharing somewhat less, and 23.6% report sharing about as much. Only about 3% report sharing more.
Concerning real name and pseudonym usage, 67.1% report using their full name (e.g. Bob Kawalski); 11.6% report using a ﬁrst name only (e.g. Bob); 16.3% reported using a pseudonym or Nickname (e..g DreamWeaver21). 4.8% reported using a fake or made-up name (e.g. Joe Smith). 10.2% of the respondents also report having more than one account on Facebook.

We ask several questions about a respondent’s degree of control and understanding with regards to how their information is shared with other Facebook users. As shown in Figure 1, we see a normal distribution across all levels for both questions.
Finally, we ask how respondents feel about their privacy with regard to Facebook and the Internet overall. As shown in Figure 2, we see similar patterns in the answers for both, with most respondents slightly or moderately concerned.
We ﬁnd little diﬀerence between the demographics of users

with at least moderate privacy concern and all others. In particular, there are no statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences based on education level, gender, income level, marital status, work status, household size and home ownership status.
Signiﬁcant diﬀerences do exist by age where most of the variation occurs between the 18-24 and 55-64 demographics, with the older users reporting more concern (Pearson correlation between age and privacy concern is .12∗∗∗). Similarly, there is a signiﬁcant negative association between feelings of control and age (r = −.24, p < .001) as there is with reported comprehension levels (r = −.3, p <.001). Finally, older users are more likely to think their friends share more personal information (r = −.18, p <.001) as do less experienced Facebook users (r = −.21, p <.001). Strongly significant diﬀerences also exist for diﬀerent ethnicities. We ﬁnd

Users who report to be very or extrememly concerned about Facebook privacy also report less engagement across several metrics. The diﬀerences are all significant at the .001 level. There are 198 users reporting to be very or extremely concerned, and 530 who report to be at most slightly concerned. Most of the users in each group answered each of the behavioral questions shown.
heightened concern levels of Hispanics and Blacks in comparison to Whites. Diﬀerences between Blacks and Whites are signiﬁcant at the .001 level, and diﬀerences between Hispanics and Whites are weakly signiﬁcant (p = .053).
Reported comprehension also varies signiﬁcantly by ethnicity. For example, Whites and Hispanics diﬀer at the .05 level (p = .009 with TukeyHSD); with .41 of Hispanics reporting to “Understand very well” or “Understand extremely well”, versus .26 of Whites.
3.1 The Nature of Privacy Concern
Based on manual coding of the 892 responses to Q23 and the 841 responses to Q24, identity theft was the most commonly cited speciﬁc concern overall. 40% of respondents express concern about identity theft; for example, “I’m concerned somebody could ﬁnd my personal information and steal my identity.” In comparison, the next most cited category is Access to Personal Data, indicated by 14%, as expressed by one respondent, “I am concerned that people have access to info about me that I would not knowingly like them to have.” Three categories followed with 11% respondents each: Unspeciﬁed Anxiety (fear without a speciﬁc concern, e.g. “It is just not good to provide such personal information about yourself. You never know what could happen.”), hacking (unauthorized digital account break-ins, e.g. “That hackers can use my personal information for evil purposes”), and ﬁnancial loss (e.g. “people getting money out of my accounts”).
From our set of 23 codes, we manually cluster 5 metacategories of concerns. These are Financial, Digital World, Physical World, Meta-Attitudes, and General Fears. Financial and digital world concerns were each speciﬁed by about half of respondents, while other meta categories had much

lower incidence. With a follow-up to Q23, we probe the potential conse-
quences of the concerns mentioned by participants in Q23. Identity theft is the most cited potential consequence, 35% of respondents. Fnancial loss is mentioned by 23% and unspeciﬁed anxieties by 10%.
In the meta-category distribution, fewer respondents note Digital World consequences than Digital World concerns (38% less frequently), thus more respondents cite concerns across all other categories. The fact that Digital World themes are the only meta-category to diminish may suggest a framework that people use to assess their privacy concerns. It reﬂects that while the online space is a catalyst for privacy concerns, the ultimate consequences are more often realized outside this milieu and it is the impact on their real lives that people most fear. By addressing the catalyst, we may simultaneously lessen the fear of the consequences brought on by perceived weaknesses in digital privacy.
We did not try to correlate particular consequences with speciﬁc concerns, but did notice some qualitative trends. Not all respondents who initially express concrete concerns can describe concrete ramiﬁcations. Instead their concerns augment into unspeciﬁed anxiety. For example one respondent concretely stated their primary concern online as “ID theft” yet broadly articulated the potential consequence of identity theft as “Never know what people will do with your personal information.” In a similar pattern, a respondent noted tangible concern of “Just plain old theft using your info to obtain items or money etc.” yet described the consequence with the dramatically abstract response of “Destroying your life”.
This pattern of response suggests that some people can

express a fear more deﬁnitively than the actual plight of the victim. To accurately predict the potential risks of a privacy breach the user would likely need ﬁrst hand experience or substantial domain knowledge. Lacking both of these traits, the user can remain in an anxiety loop. Despite having speciﬁc concerns, without an understanding of the potential consequences of those concerns, they are unable to identify tools and actions to mitigate them. Therefore to successfully build privacy understanding and trust, our education and policies would beneﬁt by addressing both levels of fears: online privacy concerns and their widely interpreted consequences.
The sentiments in the free text responses are compatible with other survey responses. For example, only 6% of users report actual sharing accidents stemming from one of their posts in Facebook (Q14 5). There is also a low rate of negative experiences connected to proﬁle ﬁelds amongst those who provide content in those ﬁelds, but also a high rate of uncertainty around whether the ﬁelds could have led to positive or negative experiences. Table 7 summarizes the results.
Compatible with Tables 5 and 6, most reported privacy concern with sharing proﬁle information is focused on Facebook’s access to the information and the potential for identity theft. Users have little concern with being embarrassed in front of other users by proﬁle information. Table 8 presents results for birth date and city of residence results; both are typical of proﬁle demographics.
3.2 The Relationship between Privacy Concern and User Engagement
For each of the social network-speciﬁc privacy aspects, Q22, Q21, Q20 and Q19, we ﬁnd signiﬁcant associations with several engagement metrics including frequency of visiting, posting, commenting and “Like”ing content. The frequency of each generally increases as privacy concern decreases. Similarly, the engagement metrics generally increase with sharing comprehension, sharing control and sharing of personal information relative to others. We present all the Pearson correlations in Table 9. In this section we look more closely at each privacy aspect and its association with engagement, providing numerical and visual evidence for each.
Figure 3 provides a concrete example of the relationship between privacy and engagement for the general privacy question, Q22. Activity levels are shown for users who are very or extremely concerned about privacy (n = 198) and those with at most “slight” privacy concern (n = 530).
Figure 4 provides another illustration of the relationship between privacy and engagement, for Q21. We see that users who report to understand better how their information is shared in Facebook are more likely visit Facebook frequently.
Importantly, these associations with engagement generally persist when we control for visit frequency. That is, if we look at users who report to visit at about the same rate, then their frequency of posting, commenting, “Like”ing, etc., varies according to their reported privacy concerns as described above. We ﬁnd users who visit daily and report to share personal information about as much as their friends show consistently more engagement than those who also visit several times a week but share somewhat less personal information than their friends. We see similar results for Q20, Q21, and Q22.

A linear model also shows that the signiﬁcant association between the privacy aspects and posting (Q7 01) persists when we control for visit frequency. Table 10 shows how frequency of posting by weekly visitors can be predicted from the privacy aspects Q19, Q20, Q21 and Q22 of weekly visitors.
Finally, Table 11 shows how the low engagement and high engagement users tend to cluster according to the privacy aspects. In particular, those who do not post status announcements report low control and low relative sharing, whereas the active posters report greater control and relative sharing.
Privacy concerns are also closely associated with an indirect indication of engagement, Facebook network size. Reported privacy concern (Q22) is negatively associated with Facebook network size (r = −.1, p <.001), feelings of control (Q20) are positively associated (.12, p <.001), sharing comprehension (Q21) is positively associated (r = .17, p <.001) and the perception that the user is sharing personal information at a rate on par or exceeding their friends is positively associated (r = .15, p <.001, Q19).
3.3 Proﬁle Visibility and Restriction
Facebook and other social networks provide controls over the visibility of proﬁle data. We ﬁnd that increased feelings of control are associated with increased use of these features. We ﬁnd diﬀerences between users reporting moderate and little control are signiﬁcant at the .001 level in terms of visibility restriction for various proﬁle ﬁelds such as phone, email and interests; at the .01 level for address and relationship status; and at the .05 level for picture. Diﬀerences for birth date and city are only weakly signiﬁcant.
Users who perceive their friends share more personal information are less likely to use their real names in FB. For example 34% of those who report they share “somewhat less” or “much less” than their friends, do not use their real name. In contrast 26% of those who share “about as much”, “somewhat more” or “much more” than their friends, use their real name in Facebook.
Interestingly, users who choose to use nicknames or fake names in Facebook do not report to have signiﬁcantly more control in Facebook than others, and on average they report less control. This is in contrast to the proﬁle visibility controls and may reﬂect the fact that nicknames and fake names are not an oﬃcially sanctioned control option, but rather, are discouraged by Facebook.
Similarly, withholding proﬁle information (i.e. not providing it) is also associated with signiﬁcantly less feelings of control except for gender (which more than 69% of users make publicly visible) and home address (which 86% of users withhold). In addition, users who report to have low control, often do not use visibility controls – more than 40% of the users reporting little control do not limit the visibility of any of the proﬁle ﬁelds in Q15. We also note that of the users who choose to either withhold, make public or provide fake information, the most popular approach is a combination of public and withheld (86%)
4. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
We have shown that self-reported activity in Facebook is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent for users who do and do not express privacy concerns. Users with privacy concern report to be less engaged across a variety of metrics, even when control-

ling for time spent using Facebook. While such a result may be intuitively reasonable, we are not aware of any large-scale studies demonstrating this association.
Of course, our study can only show a strong negative association between privacy concern and engagement; it is not designed to determine whether the relationship is causal. In the following subsections we discuss some of the potential explanations for this association and ways to investigate causality. We conclude with speciﬁc design implications stemming from our work.
4.1 Limitations
The relationship between privacy concern and engagement is likely complex. Users with privacy concern may interact with Facebook in suﬃciently diﬀerent ways than other users to impact their knowledge of the service, which itself may hinder engagement. Compatible with this, we ﬁnd a negative association between self-reported comprehension and data control, and privacy concern.
Fully understanding the complexity of the relationship may not be possible within the constraints of a survey as the potential mediating factors are diﬃcult to enumerate. In addition, causality tests beneﬁt from longitudinal study in which changes in concerns/attitudes in speciﬁc individuals can be tracked along with the behaviors of the individuals.
While additional qualitative and longitudinal research is

needed to ﬂesh out the relationship between privacy concern and engagement, we do not believe it is needed to determine the importance of the association. The strength of the association is itself evidence that privacy-concerned users are worth paying attention to as a group, regardless of the intricacies of the connection between the privacy-concerned state and low engagement.
An additional important attribute of our research is that it is entirely based on self-reports. We make no claims about associations between privacy concern and actual behavior. That said, the simple fact that a user reports to be weakly engaged is noteworthy and clearly not a desired user state from the point of view of a service provider.
4.2 Design Implications
Our work suggests three opportunities for improving privacy and engagement in social networks.
Education. As mentioned earlier, although we did not explicitly ask about awareness of proﬁle visibility controls, there is evidence suggesting that many users who would prefer such controls are not aware of them. For example, almost 39% of users do not employ any proﬁle visibility controls and 44% percent of these report having at most little control over how their information is shared in Facebook. Indeed, use of proﬁle visibility controls is associated with signiﬁcantly higher engagement for all the metrics (Q7 02-

Where NS does not appear, the association is strongly signiﬁcant.

Q7 07, p < .0001) even when restricting to those users who visit Facebook at least a few times a week. We see no evidence that this increased engagement is associated with the use of “unoﬃcial” controls. For example, in the case of pseudonyms, we do not see increased engagement amongst users with pseudonyms, rather engagement is lower on average (although generally not signiﬁcantly). The oﬃcial nature of the controls oﬀered, or even encouragement by the service provider to use the controls, may be important given the substantial amount of discomfort in sharing information with service providers (e.g. Table 8).
Utility. Proﬁle information is often withheld because users do not perceive the beneﬁts of providing it (see, Table 8. This perception may also contribute to the large number of users reporting to withhold or restrict information “as a rule” unless it is required.
Trust. 30% of the respondents expressed general fears and attitudes as explanations for their privacy concerns. For example, one respondent said, “I am concerned with people knowing thing about me that I do not want them to know. Or people knowing things that could be used against me”. Others expressed government-related fears, e.g., “The government can use my opinion against me later on.” These responses were not tied to speciﬁc experiences of the respondents or their connections and rather suggest additional trust needs to be built between these users and service providers as responsible stewards of user data. Trust is a personalized concept and so diﬃcult to broadly facilitate, but responsiveness of the service provider appears to contribute (e.g., [20, 22])

In conclusion, our work contributes to the ongoing discussion of social network privacy by oﬀering additional insights into the common privacy concerns and perceived consequences, and the impact on user engagement and information restriction. Speciﬁcally, our research oﬀers a characterization of privacy attitudes and user behaviors in Facebook (with ﬁndings relevant to any online social network) and argues for the importance of privacy concerns as a hurdle to engagement that can be overcome through education and controls.

Table 11: A comparison of reported feelings of control (Q20) and relative sharing of personal information (Q19). The left image shows those who report to never post status (n = 184, “NeverStatus”) and the right shows those who report status a few times a week (n = 252). The darker the hexagon, the more users there are who report the associated levels of control and relative sharing. Note the clustering of those who do not report status in the lower left, where reported feeling of control are the lowest and others are perceived to be sharing more personal information. In contrast, those who post status weekly are more in the center and to the right, indicating higher feelings of control and more perceived similarity with friends in personal information sharing.
