Introduction
Cooperative awareness within road traffic means that road users and roadside infrastructure are informed about each other's position, dynamics and attributes. Road users are all kind of road vehicles like cars, trucks, motorcycles, bicycles or even pedestrians and roadside infrastructure equipment including road signs, traffic lights or barriers and gates. The awareness of each other is the basis for several road safety and traffic efficiency applications with many use cases as described in ETSI TR 102 638 [i.1]. It is achieved by regular exchange of information among vehicles (V2V, in general all kind of road users) and between vehicles and road side infrastructure (V2I and I2V) based on wireless networks, called V2X network and as such is part of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS).
The information to be exchanged for cooperative awareness is packed up in the periodically transmitted Cooperative Awareness Message (CAM). The construction, management and processing of CAMs is done by the Cooperative Awareness basic service (CA basic service), which is part of the facilities layer within the ITS communication architecture ETSI EN 302 665 [1] supporting several ITS applications.
The CA basic service is a mandatory facility for all kind of ITS-Stations (ITS-S), which take part in the road traffic (vehicle ITS-S, personal ITS-S, etc.). The present document focuses on the specifications for CAMs transmitted by all vehicle ITS-Ss participating in the V2X network. Nevertheless, the present document defines the CAM format with flexibility in order to be easily extendable for the support of other types of ITS-Ss or future ITS applications.
The requirements on the performance of the CA basic service, the content of the CAM and the quality of its data elements are derived from the Basic Set of Applications (BSA) as defined in ETSI TR 102 638 [i.1] and in particular from the road safety applications as defined in ETSI TS 101 539-1 [i.8], ETSI TS 101 539-2 [i.9], and ETSI TS 101 539-3 [i.10].

4 CA basic service introduction
4.1 Background
Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAMs) are messages exchanged in the ITS network between ITS-Ss to create and maintain awareness of each other and to support cooperative performance of vehicles using the road network. A CAM contains status and attribute information of the originating ITS-S. The content varies depending on the type of the ITS-S. For vehicle ITS-Ss the status information includes time, position, motion state, activated systems, etc. and the attribute information includes data about the dimensions, vehicle type and role in the road traffic, etc. On reception of a CAM the receiving ITS-S becomes aware of the presence, type, and status of the originating ITS-S. The received information can be used by the receiving ITS-S to support several ITS applications. For example, by comparing the status of the originating ITS-S with its own status, a receiving ITS-S is able to estimate the collision risk with the originating ITS-S and if necessary may inform the driver of the vehicle via the HMI. Multiple ITS applications may rely on the CA basic service. It is assigned to domain application support facilities in ETSI TS 102 894-1 [i.6].
Besides the support of applications the awareness of other ITS-S gained by the CA basic service may be used in the networking & transport layer for the position dependent dissemination of messages, e.g. DENM by GeoBroadcasting as specified in ETSI EN 302 636-4-1 [i.5]. The generation and transmission of CAM is managed by the CA basic service by implementing the CAM protocol.
4.2 Services provided by CA basic service
The CA basic service is a facilities layer entity that operates the CAM protocol. It provides two services: sending and receiving of CAMs. The CA basic service uses the services provided by the protocol entities of the ITS networking & transport layer to disseminate the CAM.
4.3 Sending CAMs
The sending of CAMs comprises the generation and transmission of CAMs. In the course of CAM generation the originating ITS-S composes the CAM, which is then delivered to the ITS networking & transport layer for dissemination. The dissemination of CAMs may vary depending on the applied communication system. In the ITS-G5A network, defined in ETSI EN 302 663 [5], CAMs are sent by the originating ITS-S to all ITS-Ss within the direct communication range. This communication range may, inter alia, be influenced in the originating ITS-S by changing the transmit power.
CAMs are generated periodically with a frequency controlled by the CA basic service in the originating ITS-S. The generation frequency is determined taking into account the change of own ITS-Ss status, e.g. change of position or speed as well as the radio channel load as determined by DCC.
4.4 Receiving CAMs
Upon receiving a CAM, the CA basic service makes the content of the CAM available to the ITS applications and/or to other facilities within the receiving ITS-S, such as a Local Dynamic Map (LDM).

5 CA basic service functional description

5.1 CA basic service in the ITS architecture
Sending CAMs as part of the CA basic service shall be present in all ITS-S, which take part in the road traffic (vehicle ITS-S, personal ITS-S, etc.).
The CA basic service is a facilities layer entity of the ITS-S architecture as defined in ETSI EN 302 665 [1]. It may interface with other entities of the facilities layer and with the ITS application layer in order to collect relevant information for CAM generation and to forward the received CAM content for further processing. The CA basic service within the ITS-S architecture and the logical interfaces to other layers and potentially to entities within the facility layer are presented in Figure 1.
In a vehicle ITS-S entities for the collection of data may be the Vehicle Data Provider (VDP) and the Position and Time management (POTI) and for received data the Local Dynamic Map (LDM) as receiving terminal. The VDP is connected with the vehicle network and provides the vehicle status information. The POTI, as specified in ETSI TS 102 890-3 [i.14], provides the position of the ITS-S and time information. The LDM as outlined in ETSI TR 102 863 [i.3] is a database in the ITS-S, which may be updated with received CAM data. ITS applications may retrieve information from the LDM for further processing.
The CA basic service interfaces through the NF-SAP with the networking & transport layer (N&T) for exchanging of CAM messages with other ITS-Ss, the SF-SAP with the Security entity to access security services for CAM transmission and CAM reception, the MF-SAP with the Management entity and the FA-SAP with the application layer if received CAM data are provided directly to the applications.
The functionalities of the CA basic service are defined in clause 5.2, the interfaces in Figure 2 are defined in clause 5.3.

Figure 1: CA basic service within the ITS-S architecture
5.2 CA basic service functional architecture
The CA basic service is part of the Application Support domain of the Facilities Layer according to ETSI TS 102 894-1 [i.6]. Figure 2 shows the functional block diagram with the functional blocks of the CA basic service and interfaces to other facilities and layers, which are detailed in the following. The interfaces to other entities and layers are defined in clause 5.3.

5.3 Interfaces of the CA basic service
5.3.1 Interface to ITS applications
An ITS application is an application layer entity that implements the logic for fulfilling one or more ITS use cases. ITS applications are defined in ETSI TS 101 539-1 [i.8], ETSI TS 101 539-2 [i.9] and ETSI TS 101 539-3 [i.10]. For the provision of received data the CA basic service provides the interface IF.CAM to LDM or to ITS application layer, as illustrated in Figure 2.

ETSI EN 302 637-2 V1.3.2 (2014-11)

NOTE:

The interface to the ITS application layer may be implemented as API and data are exchanged between the CA basic service and ITS applications via this API. In another possible implementation, the interface to the application layer may be implemented as FA-SAP. Specifications of the FA-SAP and the corresponding protocols and APIs are out of scope of the present document.

5.3.2 Interface to data provisioning facilities
For the generation of CAMs, the CA basic service interacts with other facilities layer entities in order to obtain the required data. This set of facilities that provides data for CAM generation is referred to as data provisioning facilities. Data are exchanged between the data provisioning facilities and the CA basic service via the interface IF.FAC
NOTE: Specifications of the interface to the data provisioning facilities and the corresponding protocols are out of scope of the present document.

5.3.3 Interface to the Networking & Transport Layer

The CA basic service exchanges information with ITS Networking & Transport Layer via the interface IF.N&T (Figure 2). A specification of the interface IF.N&T as NF-SAP (Figure 1) is provided in ETSI TS 102 723-11 [i.13].
At the originating ITS-S, the CA basic service shall provide the CAM embedded in a Facility-layer Service Data Unit (FL-SDU) together with protocol control information (PCI) according to ETSI EN 302 636-5- [i.7] to the ITS Networking & Transport Layer. At the receiving ITS-S, the ITS networking & transport layer will pass the received CAM to the CA basic service, if available.
NOTE: Central ITS-Ss (e.g. traffic control centre) exist, which do not have any CA basic service, see ETSI EN 302 665 [1].
The minimum data set that shall be passed between CA basic service and ITS Networking & Transport Layer for the originating and receiving ITS-S is specified in Table 1.

A CAM may use the IPv6 stack or the combined IPv6/GeoNetworking stack for CAM dissemination as specified in ETSI TS 102 636-3 [i.4].

NOTE:

When the CAM dissemination makes use of the combined IPv6/GeoNetworking stack, the interface between the CA basic service and the combined IPv6/GeoNetworking stack may be identical to the interface between the CA basic service and IPv6 stack. The transmission of CAM over the IPv6 stack is out of scope of the present document.

5.3.5 Interface to the Management entity
The CA basic service may exchange primitives with management entity of the ITS-S via the MF-SAP interface (Figure 1). In an originating ITS-S the CA basic service gets information for setting the T_GenCam_DCC from the management entity defined in clause 6.1.3 via the IF.Mng interface (Figure 2).

6 CAM dissemination
6.1 CAM dissemination concept
6.1.1 CAM dissemination requirements
Point-to-multipoint communication, specified in ETSI TS 102 636-3 [i.4], shall be used for transmitting CAMs. In case ITS G5 is used for CAM dissemination, the control channel (G5-CCH) as specified in ETSI EN 302 663 [5] shall be used. The CAM shall be transmitted only from the originating ITS-S in a single hop to the receiving ITS-Ss located in the direct communication range of the originating ITS-S. A received CAM shall not be forwarded to other ITS-Ss.
6.1.2 CA basic service activation and termination
CA basic service activation may vary for different types of ITS-S, e.g. vehicle ITS-S, road side ITS-S, personal ITS-S. As long as the CA basic service is active, the CAM generation shall be triggered and managed by the CA basic service.
For vehicle ITS-S, the CA basic service shall be activated with the ITS-S activation. The CA basic service shall be terminated when the ITS-S is deactivated.
The activation and deactivation of the CA basic service other than the vehicle ITS-S is not specified in the present document.

ETSI

17

ETSI EN 302 637-2 V1.3.2 (2014-11)

6.1.3 CAM generation frequency management for vehicle ITS-Ss

The CAM generation frequency is managed by the CA basic service; it defines the time interval between two consecutive CAM generations. Considering the requirements as specified in ETSI TS 101 539-1 [i.8], ETSI TS 101 539-2 [i.9] or ETSI TS 101 539-3 [i.10] the upper and lower limits of the transmission interval are set as follows:

• The CAM generation interval shall not be inferior to T_GenCamMin = 100 ms. This corresponds to the CAM generation rate of 10 Hz.

• The CAM generation interval shall not be superior to T_GenCamMax = 1 000 ms. This corresponds to the CAM generation rate of 1 Hz.

Within these limits the CAM generation shall be triggered depending on the originating ITS-S dynamics and the channel congestion status. In case the dynamics of the originating ITS-S lead to a reduced CAM generation interval, this interval should be maintained for a number of consecutive CAMs. The conditions for triggering the CAM generation shall be checked repeatedly every T_CheckCamGen. T_CheckCamGen shall be equal to or less than T_GenCamMin.

The parameter T_GenCam_Dcc shall provide the minimum time interval between two consecutive CAM generations in order to reduce the CAM generation according to the channel usage requirements of Decentralized Congestion Control (DCC) as specified in ETSI TS 102 724 [i.16]. This facilitates the adjustment of the CAM generation rate to the remaining capacity of the radio channel in case of channel congestion. The parameter T_ GenCam_Dcc shall be provided by the management entity as specified in clause 5.3.5 in the unit of milliseconds. The value range of T_GenCam_DCC shall be limited to T_GenCamMin ≤ T_GenCam_DCC ≤ T_GenCamMax. If the management entity provides this parameter with a value above T_GenCamMax, T_GenCam_DCC shall be set to T_GenCamMax and if the value is below T_GenCamMin or if this parameter is not provided, the T_GenCam_Dcc shall be set to T_GenCamMin.

The parameter T_GenCam represents the currently valid upper limit of the CAM generation interval. The default value of T_GenCam shall be T_GenCamMax. T_GenCam shall be set to the time elapsed since the last CAM generation, if a CAM is triggered due to condition 1). After triggering the number of N_GenCam consecutive CAMs due to condition 2), T_GenCam shall be set to T_GenCamMax. The value of the parameter N_GenCam can be dynamically adjusted according to some environmental conditions. The default and maximum value of N_GenCam shall be 3.

EXAMPLE:

N_GenCam can be increased when approaching an intersection in order to increase the probability of CAM reception.

In detail the CAM generation trigger conditions shall be as follows:

1) The time elapsed since the last CAM generation is equal to or greater than T_GenCam_Dcc and one of the following ITS-S dynamics related conditions is given:

- the absolute difference between the current heading of the originating ITS-S and the heading included in the CAM previously transmitted by the originating ITS-S exceeds 4°;

- the distance between the current position of the originating ITS-S and the position included in the CAM previously transmitted by the originating ITS-S exceeds 4 m;

- the absolute difference between the current speed of the originating ITS-S and the speed included in the CAM previously transmitted by the originating ITS-S exceeds 0,5 m/s.

2) The time elapsed since the last CAM generation is equal to or greater than T_GenCam and equal to or greater than T_GenCam_Dcc.

If one of the above two conditions is satisfied, a CAM shall be generated immediately.

When a CAM needs to be generated, the CA basic service shall construct the mandatory containers as specified in clause 7.1. The mandatory containers mainly include the high dynamic information of the originating ITS-S, as {CAM.cam.basicContainer} and {CAM.cam.camParameters.highFrequencyContainer} as specified in annex A. Optionally, a CAM may include optional data. The optional data mainly include the status of the originating ITS-S which is less dynamic, as {CAM.cam.camParameters.lowFrequencyContainer} and specific information as included for a specific type of originating ITS-S, as {CAM.cam.camParameters.specialVehicleContainer} as specified in annex A.

ETSI

18

ETSI EN 302 637-2 V1.3.2 (2014-11)

The low frequency container shall be included in the first CAM generation since the CA basic service activation. After that the low frequency container of CAM shall be included if time elapsed since the generation of the last CAM with the low frequency container generation is equal to or greater than 500 ms.
For special vehicles, the special-vehicle container shall be included in the first CAM generation since the CA basic service activation. After that, a special vehicle container shall be included if the time elapsed since the generation of the last CAM with a special vehicle container is equal to or greater than 500 ms.

6.1.4 CAM generation frequency management for RSU ITS-Ss
The CAM generation frequency for RSU ITS-Ss defined by the time interval between two consecutive CAM generations shall be set in such a way, that at least one CAM is transmitted while a vehicle is in the communication zone of the RSU ITS-S. The time interval shall be greater than or equal to 1 000 ms. This corresponds to a maximum CAM generation rate of 1 Hz.
NOTE: The probability for the reception of a CAM from an RSU by a passing vehicle depends on the generation rate of the CAM and the time the vehicle is within the communication zone, which depends on the vehicle speed and the RSU transmission power.

6.1.5 CAM time requirement

6.1.5.1

CAM generation time

Besides the CAM generation frequency the time required for the CAM generation and the timeliness of the data taken for the message construction are decisive for the applicability of data in the receiving ITS-Ss. In order to ensure proper interpretation of received CAMs, each CAM shall be time-stamped.

NOTE: An acceptable time synchronization between the different ITS-Ss is expected.

Time required for a CAM generation shall be less than 50 ms. The time required for a CAM generation refers to the time difference between time at which CAM generation is triggered and time at which the CAM is delivered to networking transport layer.

6.1.5.2

CAM Time stamp

The following requirements shall apply:

• The time stamp given in the vehicle ITS-S CAM shall correspond to the time at which the reference position of the originating ITS-S given in this CAM was determined. The format and range of the time stamp is defined in clause B.3.

• The time stamp given in the RSU ITS-S CAM shall be the time of generation.

• The difference between CAM generation time and time stamp shall be less than 32 767 ms.

NOTE 1: This requirement is set to avoid time stamp wrap-around situation.

NOTE 2: The specification of the ITS-S Time precision and synchronization is out of scope of the present document.

6.2 CAM dissemination constraints

6.2.1 General Confidence Constraints
Several data elements of the CAM may vary with regard to accuracy or confidence. For these data elements data frames are specified providing data element together with confidence information as presented in annex B.

ETSI EN 302 637-2 V1.3.2 (2014-11)

6.2.2 Security constraints

6.2.2.1

Introduction

The security mechanisms for ITS consider the authentication of messages transferred between ITS-Ss with certificates. A certificate indicates its holder's permissions to send a certain set of messages and optionally privileges for specific data elements within these messages. The format for the certificates is specified in ETSI TS 103 097 [i.17].

Within the certificate the permissions and privileges are indicated by a pair of identifiers, the ITS-AID and the SSP.

The ITS-Application Identifier (ITS-AID) as given in ETSI TR 102 965 [i.18] indicates the overall type of permissions being granted: for example, there is an ITS-AID that indicates that the sender is entitled to send CAMs.

The Service Specific Permissions (SSP) is a field that indicates specific sets of permissions within the overall permissions indicated by the ITS-AID: for example, there may be an SSP value associated with the ITS-AID for CAM that indicates that the sender is entitled to send CAMs for a specific vehicle role.

An incoming signed CAM is accepted by the receiver if the certificate is valid and the CAM is consistent with the ITS-AID and SSP in its certificate.

6.2.2.2

Service Specific Permissions (SSP)

The CAM-SSP octet scheme allows the SSP format to accommodate current and future versions of the present document. The octet scheme is constructed out of three octets as illustrated in (Figure 3).

For each octet, the most significant bit (MSB) shall be the leftmost bit. The transmission order shall always be the MSB first. The first octet shall control the SSP version and be interpreted in the following way:

0:

no version, length one octet; the value shall only be used for testing purposes.

1:

first version, length three octets, SSP contains information as defined in the present document.

2 to 255: reserved for future usage.

The SSP has a maximum length as specified in TS 103 097 [i.17]. The first octet shall reflect the version of the present document. As future versions of the present document are published, the first octet shall be accordingly incremented. The remaining octets shall be based on the permissions described in the present document (see Table 1).

Length of SSP is the length of the Octet String.

Annex C (informative): Protocol operation of the CA basic service
C.1 Introduction
This annex provides a timer controlled approach for the protocol operation as one potential variant compliant to the present document. It is distinguished between the originating ITS-S operation and the receiving ITS-S operation considered in the following clauses. Following specification of the protocol operation is organized in three parts:
1) Protocol data setting rules specify the setting of the relevant data elements used by the protocol. 2) The general protocol operation specifies the sequence of protocol operations. 3) Exception handling specifies additional protocol operations that extend the general protocol operation. They
are applied when special conditions, referred to exceptions (for example inconsistent data) occur. An ITS-S maintains a local data structure, referred to as "ITS-S message table". This data structure holds information about sent or received CAM messages. It is out of scope of the present document to describe how this data structure is implemented.
C.2 Originating ITS-S operation
C.2.1 Protocol data setting rules
The data settings for the originating ITS-S operation are specified in annex B.
C.2.2 T_CheckCamGen
The timer T_CheckCamGen schedules the time at which the CAM generation conditions are checked by the CA basic service, its time out value is specified in clause 6.1.3.
C.2.3 Originating ITS-S message table
The CA basic service stores at least the following information for the CAM originating ITS-S operation: • CAM generation time; • ITS-S position as included in CAM; • ITS-S speed as included in CAM; • ITS-S heading as included in CAM.

ETSI

37

ETSI EN 302 637-2 V1.3.2 (2014-11)

C.2.4 General protocol operation
The originating ITS-S protocol starts when the CA basic service is activated as specified in clause 6.1.1. An originating ITS-S may execute the following operations:
1) set T_ CheckCamGen and start the timer; 2) when the timer T_CheckGenCam expires, check the CAM generation conditions:
a) if any of the condition is satisfied, continues the operation; b) if none of the condition is satisfied, skip step 3) to step 7); 3) collect data for mandatory containers; 4) check if optional containers are to be added for CAM generation: a) if yes, check the ITS-S type and ITS-S role and collect data for optional containers; b) if no, continue the operation; 5) encode CAM; 6) pass CAM to the ITS networking & transport layer; 7) save data required as specified in clause C.2.3 for next CAM generation; 8) restart the timer T_ CheckCamGen.

C.2.5 CAM construction exception
If the CA basic service could not construct a CAM successfully in step 5) as defined in clause C.2.4, the CA basic service is expected to omit step 6) to step 8) and is expected to restart the timer T_CheckCamGen.
NOTE 1: The failure of the CAM construction may happen, if the CA basic service was not able to collect all required data for the CAM construction, or the collected data are not compliant to the CAM format as specified in annex A (e.g. the value of a data is out of authorized range of the ASN.1 definition).
NOTE 2: If the CAM construction failure was due to a data provided by other entities via the interface IF.FAC, CA basic service may provide a failure notification to the corresponding data provision facilities via the IF.FAC.

C.3 Receiving ITS-S operation
C.3.1 Protocol data setting rules
No protocol data need to be set for the receiving ITS-S.
C.3.2 General protocol operation
The ITS-S receiver protocol starts when the CA basic service receives a CAM and executes the following operations: 1) decode received CAM; 2) make CAM data available by e.g. passing to the ITS application layer or to the LDM; 3) end of operation, wait for the next CAM reception.

C.3.3 Exception handling

C.3.3.1 CAM decoding exception
If the CA basic service could not decode a CAM successfully in step 1) as defined in clause C.3.2, the CA basic service omits step 2) and step 3).
NOTE: The failure of the CAM decoding may happen, if the CA basic service checks that the data included in a received CAM is not compliant to the CAM format as specified in annex A (e.g. the value of a data is out of authorized range of the ASN.1 definition).

Annex E (informative): Extended CAM generation
This annex describes an additional trigger condition for the CAM message generation, which enables ITS applications to increase the CAM generation frequency.
Depending on the requirements of an ITS application it may provide the parameter T_GenCam_App representing the needed CAM generation interval. T_GenCam_App should be provided in the unit of milliseconds and with a value range of T_GenCamMin ≤ T_GenCam_App ≤ T_GenCamMax. In case an ITS application provides this parameter with a value below T_GenCamMin, T_GenCam_App would be set to T_GenCamMin and if the value is above T_GenCamMax or this parameter is not provided, the T_GenCam_App would be set to T_GenCamMax. In case several ITS applications require different values the lowest generation interval would be applied.
In addition to the CAM trigger conditions defined in clause 6.1.3 following condition would apply:
1) the time since last CAM generation is equal to or greater than T_GenCam_App and equal to or greater than T_GenCam_Dcc.
In case the requested CAM generation frequency will not be achieved, the CA basic service should return a failure notification to the requesting application.
