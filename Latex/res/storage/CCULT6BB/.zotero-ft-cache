Abstract

I investigate the phenomenon of user resistance

behavior concerning internal social networking sites

through an empirical analysis of the behavioral at-

titudes of 253 working professionals from various

sectors and all company sizes. Results from linear

regression analysis indicates the importance the role

of privacy concerns play in explaining user resistance

behavior phenomenon. In addition, I found consider-

able negative interrelations between privacy concerns

 ¡ and perceived usefulness (rP C¡P U

well as privacy concerns and perceived ease of use

 ¡ (rP C¡P E

tion modeling using privacy concerns, usefulness and

ease of use reveals an impressive predictive power

1. Introduction

I deﬁne an internal social networking site (ISNS) as a social networking site (SNS, [1]) which is operated by a company, whose access is restricted to members of this company and which offers the members of the company the possibility to set up a personal proﬁle and to connect with other members of the company. Hence, my deﬁnition does not include inter-organisational networks as examined in [2]–[4].
More and more companies such as IBM, Microsoft, Deloitte or Best Buy have implemented their own ISNS to internally improve the knowledge management and the building and maintaining of relationships with coworkers [5]–[13]. Companies have invested considerable amounts of money [13]–[16], time [15,16] and human resources [16] in ISNSs resulting in a great functionality and usability potential [13]–[23]. However, a lot of employees avoid using it [24]–[26].

To try to explain this resistance1 behavior, research ﬁrst focused on the established information systems (IS) acceptance models (e.g. TAM [29], UTAUT(2) [30,31]) and also conﬁrmed inﬂuences of these classical/general factors for ISNSs (most important: perceived usefulness [19,32] and ease of use [33]). After that, in order to try to improve the prediction power of the classical IS acceptance models, researchers extended the models by non-individual factors (cultural factors, geographic location, social/peer group inﬂuence, relational ties, management support, one’s rank in the hierarchy, or incentives [19,23,32]–[36]).
Recent research is currently also focusing on individual factors such as trust [32,33], risk [32] or controllability [19]. Interestingly, research lacks any investigation of the role of privacy concerns as an explanatory factor for the usage intention of ISNSs, even though IS-research revealed privacy concerns as an important user resistance factor in general [37]–[44] and also on public SNS [41,45]–[52]. In addition, there is not only a gap in the extant literature concerning privacy concerns as antecedents of ISNS resistance but also on the interplay between privacy concerns and the classical/general factors of ISNS usage (i.e. perceived usefulness [19,32] and ease of use [33]).
This is a very interesting research gap because privacy concerns may explain the still empirically observed ISNS avoidance behavior of employees [24]– [26] despite huge company investments in usefulness and ease of use resulting in a greater functionality and usability potential [13]–[23]. There is thus a theoretical gap concerning the role of privacy concerns in ISNS usage. As prior research has shown that the cost-beneﬁt ratio [37,40,53]–[56] of publishing private information is much higher (especially more risky) in working/employer-employee settings compared to public environments [40,45,57]–[64], it can be spec-
1. I use the word “resistance” as the opposite of acceptance (following [27]); other researchers deﬁned “resistance” as an own construct (e.g. [28]).

ulated that privacy concerns can signiﬁcantly explain the avoidance problem of employees not using the companies’ ISNS.
That is why in this paper I empirically analyze the inﬂuence of privacy concerns on the intention to use an ISNS by studying working professionals from various sectors and any company sizes. To the best of my knowledge, there is no other similar study. Not only could results from this investigation have implications for theorizing the role of privacy concerns in ISNS usage but they may also have implications for the importance of managing privacy concerns by the companies.
The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 spans the research background from ISNSs (2.1) via the research results on ISNS acceptance (2.2) to the state of the art of privacy concerns in public and internal SNSs (2.3) – thus identifying the research need. In section 3 the research methodology is presented, including the research model and the hypotheses (3.1) as well as the sampling strategy (3.2) and all measurements (3.3). Section 4 contains the results including sample characteristics (4.1), socio-demographical effects on privacy concerns (4.2), a comparison of users and non-users (4.3), linear regression analysis outcomes (4.4), structural model results (4.5) and model quality evaluation outcomes (4.6). The results are discussed in section 5. Finally, the conclusion is given in section 6, including limitations (6.1) and future research (6.2).
2. Research Background
2.1. Internal social networking sites
As various possibilities exist for implementing social media into the internal communication processes of companies, many different versions and descriptions of tools implementing social media in companies have been developed. Similarly, research on the topic sees different expressions employed to describe these features, social software [19], employee portals [65]– [67], business-to-employee-portals [65,68], wikis or weblogs [19], enterprise social software platforms [33], intra-organizational electronic networks [35] and enterprise social networks [34]. Most of these applications share the common feature that access is restricted to company members and that employees may set up an account and connect with others.
One of the main applications of ISNSs lies in the domain of knowledge management. Therefore, various studies have investigated ISNS-based knowledge management practices and the factors affecting knowledge sharing in ISNSs [5]–[8]. Even more speciﬁcally, the

performance of teams using ISNSs for knowledge sharing has been investigated [9]–[12]. Various other aspects of ISNSs have also been examined in recent years. A major part of the research on ISNSs focuses on the assessment of their success, key factors for successful implementation and improvement potentials [23,66,67,69]. Another major research stream shows the many individual and competitive advantages accompanying the usage of ISNSs in companies such as supporting communication [13,15,20], collaboration [13,13,15,20] and relationships between colleagues [13,19]; or the improvement of the individuals’ and organizations’ knowledge base [13,15,19,20] and the innovation- [15], morale- [17], cost- [15,23], turnover[17], and productivity-situation [13,15,17,19]–[22].
However, despite of all these advantages there is still a limited practical use for it among employees [24]– [26]. Therefore, my research is focused on understanding the adoption of ISNSs.
2.2. Acceptance research on internal social networking sites
Early research on the acceptance and the intention to use (IU) ISNSs started around 2000 with examinations of the adoption and development of intranets [70]. Simultaneously with the development of the Web 2.0, early research on Web 2.0 technologies, e.g. social networking sites, in companies and their growing importance emerged [71]–[73]. Since then, a lot of research has been conducted on different factors inﬂuencing the adoption of ISNSs. Research revealed (1) perceived usefulness [19,32] and (2) ease of use [33] as the most important factors of ISNS acceptance – in line with prior knowledge from established IS acceptance models (e.g. TAM [29], UTAUT(2) [30,31]). However, despite huge company investments in usefulness and ease of use of their ISNS, a lot of employees still avoid using it [24]–[26].
That is why recent research currently also focuses on non-individual factors (cultural factors, geographic location, social and peer group inﬂuence, relational ties, management support, one’s rank in the company hierarchy, or incentives [19,23,32]–[36]) and individual factors such as trust [32,33], risk [32] or controllability [19]. Interestingly, there is a lack of research into the role of privacy concerns [37] as an explanatory factor for the usage intention of ISNSs, even though it is known from IS-literature that privacy concerns are a very important user resistance factor [37]–[44,56], especially on public SNSs [41,45]–[52].

2.3. Privacy concerns as an important factor explaining user resistance
IS-research revealed privacy concerns (PC) as an important user resistance factor [37]–[44,56]. Specifically, a lot of research exists on PC-conceptualizing (e.g. [37,38,74]), individual differences such as personality [39] or non-individual inﬂuences such as culture [41], the coherent negative impact of PC on IU [74] and typical user responses to information privacy threats [42]. Interestingly, research shows that perceived beneﬁts such as money [55], usefulness [75] and ease of use features [76] may outweigh PC.
2.3.1. Privacy concerns on public social network sites. PC regarding IS usage and especially internet and social media usage are a widely researched phenomenon. Various papers investigate internet users’ PC in general (e.g. [38,43,44,77,78]), their privacyprotection methods [42,79], or more speciﬁcally the relationship between personality traits and PC [39]. PC regarding public SNSs is a widely research ﬁeld of study. Part of the existing literature examines the implications of PC on self-disclosure on public SNSs [41,45,46]. The improvement of privacy settings and consequently the support of user participation on SNSs are also main research topics [47,49]. Cultural differences regarding PC on public SNSs [41,48,50] and distinctions between different public SNSs regarding PC were also investigated [51]. Additionally, there is research on PC perceptions and reality [80], the inﬂuence of PC on quitting behavior of SNSs [81] and the measurement of online privacy management [52]. The results of all these studies conﬁrmed that PC play a major role as a resistent factor on public SNSs.
2.3.2. Privacy concerns on internal social networking sites. PC on ISNSs are less widely investigated. There is some work that examines the privacy-related concepts of trust [32,33] and conﬁdentiality [65,68]. Donston-Miller [82] identiﬁed security and privacy risks for organizations and their customers accompanying ISNSs. Andriole [15] states serious concerns about intellectual property, proprietary information, privacy, security, and control on ISNSs. Wang and Kobsa [83] hypothesize a number of potential privacy issues relating to ISNSs such as impression management, peer pressure to reveal personal or working information or unintentional social undermining in the workplace, and suggest future research directions in this area. However, to the best of my knowledge, there is no further research on PC on ISNSs and their implications for the adoption of ISNSs in particular.

3. Methodology
3.1. Research model and hypothesizing
To analyze the impact of PC on IU an ISNS I adapted the technology acceptance model (TAM [29]) to ISNS and extended it by the PC construct. The resulting research model is shown in ﬁgure 1.

Figure 1: Research model and hypotheses

Literature on public SNS reveals a negative inﬂuence of PC on self-disclosing behavior on public SNSs [41,45,46] and a higher user participation on SNSs if PC are decreased [49]. PC were even found to be reasons for quitting SNSs [81]. In addition, metaanalytical research from general online information PC show a stable negative impact of PC on IU [74, p. 465]. Against this background, I hypothesize that:
H1: PC will be negatively associated with the (continued) intention to use ISNSs.
Dinev et al. argue that PC are “not absolute but [...] based on a cost-beneﬁt analysis, that is, a calculus of behavior” [37, p. 299]. This calculus perspective is described in the literature as “the most useful framework for analyzing contemporary consumer privacy concerns” [54, p. 326]. From this perspective perceived beneﬁts may have a huge impact on PC [53], e.g. monetary or non-monetary beneﬁts [55] or informationgiving [56]. Li and Unger [40] showed that “under certain circumstances, perceived personalization quality can outweigh the impact of privacy concerns” [40, p. 621]. Interestingly, besides monetary beneﬁts [55] there are two major factors which potentially outweigh privacy concerns: (1) usefulness [75] and (2) ease of use features such as the facility of customizing IS [76]. Consequently, PC are not a ﬁxed to a static value [37, p. 299]. They potentially negatively interrelate with PU [75] and PE [76]. Thus, I hypothesize that:
H2: PC will be negatively associated with PU. H3: PC will be negatively associated with PE. According to multiple initial studies [29]–[31,84] and the up-to-date meta-analytical review by Hess et al. [85, p. 19], both, PU and PE, are universally positively associated with behavioral intention. Against this background, I hypothesize that:

H4: PU will be positively associated with the (continued) intention to use ISNSs.
H5: PE will be positively associated with the (continued) intention to use ISNSs.
I consequently hypothesize the assumed negative impact of PC on IU (H1), the negative interplay of PC and PU (H2) as well as PC and PE (H3), and the positive impact of PU on IU (H4) as well as PE on IU (H5). All hypotheses are shown in ﬁgure 1. The research question (RQ) was formulated as follows: Do Privacy Concerns inﬂuence the (continued) intention to use Internal Social Network Sites stronger than Perceived Usefulness and Perceived Ease of Use do?
3.2. Sampling strategy
I recruited working professionals who studied extraoccupationally at our university. The participants were electronically asked to take part in a survey concerning social networks. The call for participation was sent out with a link to the online questionnaire via our Germany-wide university. Working backgrounds were checked (see section 4.1).
3.3. Measurements
All constructs of the research model (ﬁgure 1) were operationalized by proven and established measurement instruments (see table 1). As shown by many researchers the TAM [29] was proven numerous times before to have a high level of construct reliability [85] (Chronbach’s α were often above 0.9 which indicates redundance of the used items). I select three items for each of the constructs PU and PE from [29, p. 340]. For my purposes, I need to measure the speciﬁc PC representing a person’s privacy concerns in a given ISspeciﬁc context, not a person’s general overall concern for information privacy (cf. [74, pp. 466] and [77, p. 800]). That is why the PC items were taken from [77, p. 823] and adapted to the ISNS-context. The IU items were adapted from [30, p. 460] and [84, p. 314]. Each item was measured using a 7-point Likert scale. Furthermore I captured sociodemographic data and the occupational background of each participant.

4.2. Sociodemographic privacy concern effects

I found no signiﬁcant gender effects on the PC-

related items PC-1 to PC-4. Indeed, in line with prior

research (e.g. the meta-analytical review of Li [74]) in

my sample women are also (very slightly) more con-
s  cerned about their privacy ( ∆ 0.05), but this differ-

ence is not signiﬁcant. However, I found mixed effect

results of age on privacy concerns. While there are no

effects of age on PC-1 and PC-4 I found age-effects for

shows no better results (36.5% correct classiﬁcations). However as shown in table 2 the privacy concerns (PC) may eventually be suitable to predict the user status (user, non-user, no answer).

indication that privacy concerns are potentially more important compared to perceived ease of use when explaining the intention to use an ISNS.
4.5. Structural model results
To investigate the latent structure of the hidden constructs P U , P E, P C, and IU and their causal relations with more sophistication, I conducted a structural equation modeling using smartPLS, version 2.0.M3 by [86]. The model used the reﬂective indicators as described in table 1. Conducting the bootstrapping
 algorithm of smartPLS [86] (n 5, 000 samples) I
found that all path coefﬁcients were signiﬁcant (p 0.001). As a result, ﬁgure 4 shows the structural model explaining 73.1% of the intention to use an ISNS

As shown in ﬁgure 4, all reﬂective indicators load at a signiﬁcance level of p 0.001 from 0.607 to 0.952. The average variance extracted (AVE) values are greater than 0.5 for each construct (table 4).

ever, when I expose a two factor model to compe-

As shown in table 4 I found considerable negative

by rP C¡P E 0.459 (p 0.001, support of H3).

Furthermore I found signiﬁcant path coefﬁcients

between both the PU–IU and the PE–IU relation-

ships which leads to the support of both H4 and H5 (p 0.001). Comparing these results with the up-

to-date meta-analysis of Hess et al. [85] I can state

cP E¡IU
results of

csP0E.1¡8I2Udoes0n.5o5t 5m(actfc.h[8th5e,

p. 19]). Interestingly, in my results the intention to

use an ISNS is much more inﬂuenced by perceived

usefulness instead of perceived ease of use.

In addition, as shown in section 4.5 I can explain
 73.1% of the intention to use an ISNS (R2 0.731).

This result is impressive because both UTAUT [30] and UTAUT2 [31] reach similar R2 values for usage
 intention (UTAUT R2 0.77 [30, p. 465], UTAUT2  R2 0.74 [31, p. 169]), but included much more

constructs (UTAUT includes eight and UTAUT2 ten

constructs/moderators). My model only needs three

constructs (PU, PE, PC).

Furthermore, results from linear regression analysis

and structural model results indicate that privacy con-

cerns are at least as important compared to perceived

ease of use when explaining ISNS usage intention.

The implications of this research are twofold. From

a theoretical point of view, an ISNS-situational substi-

tution of perceived ease of use by privacy concerns is

potentially indicated but needs further investigation. At
least the rP U, P Cs Ñ rIU s model is a serious alter-

native to TAM [29] when analyzing ISNS usage behav-

ior. From a practical point of view, companies should

invest in lowering ISNS-speciﬁc privacy concerns such

as trust-building measures or monetary compensations

before implementing the ISNS (cf. [32,33,40,55,56,75,

76,90]), as it was shown in my study that privacy con-

cerns have a major impact on the ISNS usage intention

(similar to the importance of perceived ease of use).

This practical recommendation is underpinned by the

fact that prior research revealed that speciﬁc privacy

concerns are not absolute [37,54] but changeable by ac-

tivities/beneﬁts [40,53,55,56,75,76]. In addition, due to

the considerable inﬂuence of perceived usefulness and

perceived ease of use on the ISNS usage intention and

due to the negative interrelations between privacy con-

 ¡ cerns and perceived usefulness (rP C¡P U

0.421)

as well as between privacy concerns and perceived

 ¡ ease of use (rP C¡P E

0.459) system designers

and implementing companies should pay attention both

to usefulness and ease of use. Since the impact of perceived usefulness on the usage intention is enor-
 mous (cP C¡IU 0.675) system designers are advised
to further strengthen the communication- [13,15,20], collaboration- [13,13,15,20], relationship- [13,19] and information-functions [13,15,19,20]. Companies are advised to motivate their employees by pointing to these ISNS-advantages in order to strengthen their perception of useful ISNS features.
6. Conclusion
Addressing the ISNS avoidance problem of employees [24]–[26] I investigated the role of privacy concerns on that problem, in particular on the impact of privacy concerns on intention to use an ISNS and the interplay between privacy concerns and usefulness as well as ease of use. Conducting an empirical analysis of the behavioral attitudes of 253 working professionals who had extensive industry experience coming from different sectors and all company sizes, my results indicate the important role of privacy concerns when explaining the ISNS avoidance problem. Considering the privacy concerns, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use in a structural model explaining the intention to use an ISNS, I reach an impressive
 predictive power (R2 0.731). Finally, I showed the
practical and theoretical implications of these ﬁndings.
6.1. Limitations
One limitation of my study concerns the measurement quality of the PE construct, as Chronbach’s α was only 0.588. However, I used three of the six original items from [29, p. 340] since in numerous studies Chronbach’s α were often above 0.9 which indicates redundance of the used items. Despite the bad α value, the PE construct reliability in terms of
 the composite reliability (CR 0.759) was ﬁne [89].
Another limitation is the problem that I do not know from the respondents who do not use an ISNS if they have never used ISNSs because the company they work for has not adopted ISNSs, or if they have used ISNSs before but have stopped using it.
6.2. Future research
Subsequent research should focus on the possibilities of reducing ISNS-speciﬁc privacy concerns through company activities and beneﬁts (cf. [40,53, 55,56,75,76]). In addition, future research should investigate the moderator effect of trust on the negative

Perceived Usefulness Intention to Use

PC–IU relationship as prior research, e.g. [50,56], indicated that trust may weaken the PC–IU relationship. Finally I found an interesting phenomenon in my data (Figure 5), namely that people either report a high usage intention always combined with high ratings on perceived usefulness and low on privacy concerns or vice versa (low usage intention always combined with low usefulness and high privacy concern ratings). This phenomenon could be explained by an individual’s tendency to reduce cognitive dissonance (cf. [91]), i.e. either I like/use it and everything is perfect which leads to the exclusion of any privacy concerns or I do not like/use it and everything is bad including the appearance of an individual’s privacy concerns. This is also a consideration for future research.
