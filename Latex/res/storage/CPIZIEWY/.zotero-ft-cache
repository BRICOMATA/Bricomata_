ABSTRACT
People on the Web are generating and disclosing an ever-increasing amounts of data, often without full awareness of who is recording what about them, and who is aggregating and linking pieces of data with context information, for a variety of purposes. Awareness can help users to be informed about what silently happens during their navigation while learning from disclosure of personal information may help to discriminate potential harmful activities from daily and regular activities that can be performed online. Our main objective is to study whether a highly customized tool can help users to learn the value of privacy from their behaviors and make informed decisions to reduce their degree of exposure. To this aim, we present an evaluation study to analyze general perceptions, attitudes, and beliefs about privacy online, and to explore the resultant behaviors for two diﬀerent groups of participants from an academic environment.
I INTRODUCTION
People everywhere are generating an ever-increasing amounts of data, often without being fully aware of who is tracking their actions, gathering their information, and aggregating them in order to provide free services and targeted advertising [1]. Although the behavioral advertising practice increases the effectiveness of the marketer’s campaigns1, it also has given rise to privacy concerns since private information may be collected and centralized by a limited number of companies [3]. Targeted advertising heavily relies on the use of valuable information that could lead to an accurate reconstruction of users’ interests proﬁle. Private information may be leaked to third party entities [4], that often intervene as uninvited guests during Web searches, online shopping, online business and ﬁnancial transactions, social activities or during any type of communications on the Web. However, the risk is about the ﬁnal use of these pseudo-anonymous data, that linked with personally identiﬁable information (i.e., phone number, credit

card number, social security number and so on), may be disclosed or explicitly sold to third party entities. These data could be potentially used for secondary activities, such as identity theft, social engineering attacks, online and physical stalking and so on [5–8].
Recent statistics show that 63% of users agreed with a statement of concern for third party monitoring activities [9]. In another study Krishnamurthy et al. highlighted the criticality of the problem showing that 56% of sites analyzed (75% when considering userids) directly leak sensitive and identiﬁable information to third party aggregators [10]. The disclosure of personal information to third party sites, without users’ permissions or consents, represents the greatest concern among Internet users, that call for more eﬀective solutions to protect themselves against invasions into their private aﬀairs.
Various meanings and dimensions of privacy have been discussed in literature [11, 12], even without a meaningful and accepted deﬁnition for it. More speciﬁcally, privacy has been deﬁned as synonymous of the “right to be let alone” [13], or as synonymous of the right to prevent the disclosure of personal information [14]. Privacy has been also deﬁned as the ability of the individual to control the terms under which his/her personal information is acquired and used [15]. The contextual nature is evident in several other deﬁnitions: “Individuals have privacy to the extent that others have limited access to information about them, to the intimacies of their lives, to their thoughts or their bodies” [16]. Individuals are diﬀerent in their thoughts and beliefs with behaviors that change according to environmental and personal factors or user’s orientation [17]. Finally, individuals are continuously searching for a balance between the desire for privacy and the desire for personal communication with others [18].
In this work we want to analyze if by making people aware of the information they reveal about themselves, they would take steps to prevent it. To this aim, we carried out a descriptive quantitative study to analyze whether a privacy-enhancing technology

tool that we developed, named NoTrace [19–21], is able to make tangible, or perceptible, what sometimes is underestimated by unwary users, enabling individuals to make informed decisions when invasions to their privacy occur.
In our study, two subgroups of students, namely ICT Group (i.e., technology-oriented) and non-ICT Group, were surveyed to:
1. Assess generally and also to compare each group’s understanding of privacy concerns about online activities.
2. Study whether technological knowledge may inﬂuence attitudes toward privacy, privacyrelated behavioral intentions and actual behaviors.
3. Study whether awareness and learning from own behavior may increase the willingness of people to limit the diﬀusion of personal information and protect their privacy while they are navigating the Web.
Overall, we want to evaluate whether the non-ICT Group would have more concerns about privacy when compared with the ICT Group and if technological knowledge can inﬂuence the perception of the risks about privacy, as well as the corresponding privacy behaviors. We want also to evaluate whether awareness about information leakage and learning from online personal habits and behaviors may aﬀect in the same way both groups.
The paper is organized as follows. Section II discusses some related works in the same ﬁeld. In Section III we describe the main functionalities of NoTrace, that is the privacy-enhancing tool we used in our evaluation study. In Section IV we studied whether NoTrace was able to help people to value their privacy, by making tangible what sometimes is underestimated by unwary users, and we discussed some interesting ﬁndings in Section V. We will conclude with some ﬁnal remarks in Section VI.
II RELATED WORK
Concerns about privacy are mainly focused on activities and interactions online, rather than on the typical interactions that may happen during everyday life. Over the past decade, several empirical studies have been conducted to analyze the level of concerns about privacy across US population. These surveys

covered general privacy, consumer privacy, medical and health privacy, and other privacy-related areas. Speciﬁcally, several studies addressed the analysis of the privacy in e-commerce environments [22], the privacy of health information on social media [23], the privacy that may aﬀect individual’s purchasing decisions [24], or the privacy that may be violated by the behavioral advertising [25]. Other works aimed at analyzing users’ behaviors and attitudes toward privacy, with emphasis on gender and technical differences [26–29], and on the propensity to disclose personal information [30, 31]. Recent works studied privacy concerns related to cloud storage [32], location sharing [33], and the use of Google+ circles as a means to control the information ﬂow [34].
Other recent studies in the social area show concerns among Facebook users, their strong negative association between privacy concerns and engagement (posting, commenting and Like-ing of content) [35], their willingness to change privacy settings [36], even if, in a subsequent study [37] it was discovered that, due to the constant modiﬁcations and alterations to the policy, many users (i.e., 65.7%) are unaware of how their proﬁles are aﬀected, and therefore, unaware of their personal privacy settings. Finally, Liu et al. showed that users are having trouble about correctly conﬁguring their privacy settings and call for new tools to protect privacy [38].
Overall, several studies reported that an overwhelming majority of people are very concerned about a wide range of privacy issues [39–41] and that privacy concerns inﬂuence people’s willingness to disclose personal information to a Web site [42]. However, studies analyzing the relationships between Internet users’ concerns and the actions to take to address them, discovered an apparent dichotomy between privacy attitudes and resultant behaviors [43–45]. This dichotomy involves situations in which users are less willing to take actions to protect privacy (and, therefore, more likely to share their personal information and preferences) when some beneﬁts can be obtained in return [46]. In fact, studies in this ﬁeld show that only a small percentage of users read privacy policies, mainly because users ﬁnd learning about privacy and reading privacy policies is diﬃcult and time consuming. In general, most of the users are not able to reliable understand their content [47], and therefore, they are reluctant when adopting privacy protective techniques and technologies [43, 48, 49].
Most of the reported studies explored diﬀerences in individuals in respect to their privacy concerns. Our

Page 2 of 18 ⃝c ASE 2012

goal in this work was to investigate concerns about the privacy of two groups of students from diﬀerent academic areas and with diﬀerent technological knowledge. We explored whether educating them about potential risks on the Web, through a direct learning from one’s behavior during online activities, may involve increasing awareness about privacy as well as increasing willingness to reduce their degree of exposure to privacy attacks. Finally, we have to emphasize that this work extends the analysis presented in [50].

III NOTRACE

NoTrace [19–21] is a privacy-enhancing tool, implemented as a Mozilla Firefox add-on, whose main goal is to provide several instruments to protect privacy of users during Web navigation and to limit the diﬀusion of sensitive and personally identiﬁable information.
The approach implemented by NoTrace ensures:
• Support for users, in order to help them to make informed decisions.
• Comprehensiveness, in terms of privacy threats addressed and the corresponding countermeasures provided.
• Awareness and full control over privacy leakage and countermeasures to adopt to limit its diﬀusion.
• Performance and eﬀectiveness in order to make the tool longer used by users, since excessive delays involve an abandonment by users after ﬁrst use [51].
NoTrace supports users’ needs through several privacy settings that can be ﬁne-tuned according, for example, to experience and expertise (See Fig. 1). Speciﬁcally, NoTrace oﬀers a “Standard Protection” for Novice students (with three diﬀerent levels of protections that can be selected) and a “Customized Protection” for Experienced users. The latter modality allows users to choose any of the provided countermeasures for the selected category of privacy threats they want to address that is, “Personal Information”, “Web Tracking” or “Third Party Activities and Ads” (shown in Fig. 1). Conversely to Novice, Experienced users can also ﬁne-tune the privacy settings, enabling and disabling speciﬁc functionalities whenever they want.

Fig. 1. NoTrace conﬁguration: how protection measures can be enabled. The “Blockable Objects” link allows users to inspect which objects can be blocked when selecting, with a simple check, the corresponding technique.
Conversely to other popular tools in this ﬁeld (i.e., AdBlock Plus [52], Ghostery [53], Abine [54]), that only provide an URL-based blocking mechanism, NoTrace provides new ﬁltering mechanisms that are able to access the stream of bytes received by the browser immediately before the rendering of the Web page. In this way, it is able to address privacy threats unprecedentedly not dealt with, as well as, avoid a large variety of loopholes and tricks that could be used to overcome the ﬁltering.
To educate users on what information about their browsing behavior is sent to third-party entities and the information that is inferred based upon their behavior, we designed NoTrace so that it can steadily monitor the Web navigation, allowing users to be constantly informed about both potential harmful activities on the Web and the extent of their personal information leakage.
Speciﬁcally, the NoTrace’s “Blocked Object Panel” allows users to inspect all blocked URLs, while to enhance awareness we show, in a speciﬁc panel, the personally identiﬁable information disclosed to third party sites, for each visited Web site (See Fig. 2).

department) according to their ﬁeld study. It must be emphasized that these two groups are statistically diﬀerent as we will show afterwards in this Section and also in Section V.

IV EVALUATION STUDY
In this Section we describe results about the comparison among two samples of students that we recruited from an university environment. As mentioned before, the main goal of this study is to ﬁnd out if a highly customized privacy-enhancing tool can contribute to make users aware of their privacy leakage and increase their responsibility when managing their privacy online. Speciﬁcally, in this study, we tried to respond to the following questions:
1. Are there signiﬁcant diﬀerences among two groups of students with regards to beliefs, attitudes and concerns about privacy? (Online privacy concerns, Section V(1) for the results).
2. Experience in online activities and general technological knowledge can inﬂuence how diﬀerent users “value” their privacy? (How skills inﬂuence behaviors, Section V(2) for the results).
3. Learning about privacy through the help of a privacy-enhancing tool can involve more informed decisions about the countermeasures to adopt? Learning can aﬀect in the same way diﬀerent types of groups? (How privacy awareness can change behaviors, Section V(3) for the results).
1 METHODOLOGY

Students were recruited through email announcements to mailing lists, and word of mouth advertising. The participation in the study was voluntary and anonymous, and students were not compensated for taking part in the interviews. Participants were informed that all the information they provided would remain conﬁdential. Finally, to avoid a biased sample, when recruited participants, we did not mention privacy or security, privacy risks and beneﬁts, and we only said that we were looking for people interested in participating in an evaluation study.
The average age of the sample was 24, and the gender split was almost even (i.e., 53% female and 47% male). The majority of participants spent between two and six hours on Internet per day (72% of the non-ICT users and 50% of ICT users), while only 11% of non-ICT users and half of ICT users spent on Internet more than six hours. 83% of users in the non-ICT Group considers themselves incompetent with online activities, while 72% of ICT participants consider themselves as competent/expert (χ=9.488, p-value=0.0065, see also Table I). Statistical diﬀerences across groups are shown in Table I.

For our study we recruited 36 participants among students of the Computer Science, Cultural Heritage, Business and Law Departments at the University of Salerno. We classiﬁed students into two groups, named non-ICT Group (18 students from the Cultural Heritage, Business and Law Departments) and ICT Group (18 students from the Computer Science

2 PROCEDURE
The study was conducted at the ISISLab research laboratory, at the University of Salerno. It envisioned three diﬀerent phases in which we carried out: a preliminary survey, the tool testing, and ﬁnally, a sum-

Page 4 of 18 ⃝c ASE 2012

mary survey, respectively.
In the ﬁrst phase we asked participants to ﬁll in a preliminary questionnaire, composed of 32 questions in ﬁve categories. In this questionnaire we collected: (a) demographic information (i.e., gender, age, education level), (b) information about Internet usage, (c) general knowledge about privacy threats on the Web, (d) general attitudes toward privacy, (e) information about awareness and general behaviors about privacy online.
Speciﬁcally, the ﬁrst section asked for standard demographic information, and for technical skills (such as, time spent on Internet, level of expertise with online activities). The second part asked for general information about the preferred browser (i.e., Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, and so on) and knowledge and/or usage of browsers’ add-ons or extensions. The third part tested participants’ knowledge about some potential privacy threats on the Web (rating on a 5-point Likert scale with strongly agree/strongly disagree as verbal anchors). The fourth section tested participants’ concerns about privacy and general attitudes toward online privacy (rating on a 5-point Likert scale). The last section gauged general participants’ behaviors about privacy online.
In the tool testing phase, we asked users to use NoTrace, our evaluation tool, for a 30-minutes browsing session. We asked them to choose any of the provided modalities of privacy protection or select any of the provided advanced functionalities. We gave them details about NoTrace goals and main features. We also provided them with basic information on how to use it. Users were not directly monitored, so that they could feel free to test and explore the tool, but they could call for assistance if they did not understand any of the instructions posed. The test was performed in an isolated environment within our research lab in order to avoid distractions due to the presence of other people. Users were also encouraged to provide informal feedback such as general comments, suggestions or observations for developers.
At the end of the testing phase we asked users to spend other 10 minutes to ﬁll in the standard QUIS2 and CSUQ3 questionnaires. The aim was to provide additional information about system usability and user satisfaction when using NoTrace and diﬀerences experienced by the two tested groups. Specifically, the original QUIS questionnaire, developed at

the University of Maryland, was composed of 27 questions. We dropped 10 that did not seem to be appropriate to our tool (e.g., questions about task to execute). Each question was a rating on a 10-point scale with appropriate anchors at each end (e.g., “Overall Reaction to the software: Terrible/Wonderful”), where small values corresponded to unsatisfactory or negative responses and large values corresponded to satisfactory results. The original CSUQ questionnaire was composed of 19 questions. As we did for the QUIS questionnaire, we dropped 7 of them that not seem appropriate for our objectives (e.g., questions about work to complete). Speciﬁcally, we asked users to answer to the provided 12 questions indicating their agreement or disagreement through a 7point Likert scale with strongly agree and strongly disagree as verbal anchors.
Finally, in the third phase, we asked participants to ﬁll in a summary questionnaire, composed of 12 questions, with a rating on a 5-point Likert scale with strongly agree/strongly disagree as verbal anchors. We have to emphasize that this questionnaire also included three questions that were asked in the ﬁrst phase, in the preliminary survey. We want to measure whether any change has occurred in users’ opinions, habits or behaviors after gaining a greater awareness about certain activities performed online by third party entities, and a greater consciousness about the potentialities of the proposed tool.
The entire study lasted between 60 and 70 minutes. We included the preliminary survey, the summary survey and the QUIS and CSUQ questionnaires in the Appendix A.
Finally, for data analysis and statistics results we used IBM Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS, Inc.) software4.
V RESULTS
Results of the demographic survey have been reported in the previous Section and, speciﬁcally, in the description of the study participants. Results are shown in Table I.
When interviewed about familiarities with some privacy threats, groups showed diﬀerent results. Specifically, we asked users if they had familiarity with some privacy threats, asking them also to provide a

clear deﬁnition for terms such as “Web bug”, “Flash cookie”, “behavioral advertising”. We also asked them whether they knew the risks associated with behavioral advertising.
The non-ICT Group showed a small familiarity with these privacy threats, with agreement about familiarity with Web bug, Flash cookie and behavioral advertising of 5%, 11% and 33%, respectively. Only 28% of non-ICT users is aware of the risks of the behavioral advertising. Conversely, the ICT Group reported greater familiarity for all privacy threats. We also found statistical diﬀerences among groups, with corresponding results shown in Table II. We found a relation among the familiarity with privacy threats and concern about privacy online (question Q4 shown in Table III). Intuitively, increase of familiarity would decrease general privacy concerns (Pearson correlation between privacy concern and familiarity with Flash cookie, behavioral advertising, and behavioral advertising risks are -0.3883, -0.3434, -0.3607, p<.05, respectively).

participants equally consider the privacy very important in everyday life, while less concern is perceived by the ICT Group about privacy online (agreement for 50% of participants). We did not observe any statistical diﬀerence about privacy concerns across groups. Results are shown in Table III.
Users seem also to be concerned about tracking of their movements on the Web, performed by large business companies to provide them targeted advertising (Q10 and Q11 questions in Table III). Although aware that their browsing history may be collected for advertising purposes, more than half of participants in both groups are uncomfortable even when their personal information cannot be tied to their browsing history. Once again, we did not observe any statistical diﬀerence with regards to these concerns across groups.
To further categorize students based on their privacy concern we decided to group participants by applying standard clustering techniques [43]. Speciﬁcally, we employed the k-means [55] to investigate the data collected. We selected two questions strictly related to concerns about privacy (i.e., Q3 & Q4) and other two questions related to the behavioral advertising privacy threat (i.e., Q10 & Q11).

1 ONLINE PRIVACY CONCERNS
We look at association with self-reported concerns about privacy in everyday life (Q3), general concerns about privacy on Internet (Q4), as well as 2 questions related to the behavioral advertising (Q10 and Q11). These questions are shown in detail in Table III and also in Appendix A. We reported the questions with the same ID used in the survey questionnaires that we submitted to the participants at the study.
The analysis of concerns about privacy shows that all

In contrast to the results by Westin [56] and Ackerman et al. [57] we found out four clusters of participants. Speciﬁcally, we identiﬁed a group of Fundamentalists and a group of Marginally Concerned, while the Pragmatists group was further decomposed in two distinct groups whose privacy concerns focused either on the awareness of the risks of the behavioral advertising phenomenon or on the linking of users’ history information with personally identiﬁable information. This categorization results are shown for both groups in Table VI.
Speciﬁcally, Fundamentalists users provided privacyoriented responses to all the questions selected for that analysis, by highlighting their concerns to both beliefs about privacy online and the risks of the behavioral advertising. Marginally Concerned users exhibited mild general concerns about privacy and a propensity to enjoy the beneﬁts of the behavioral advertising but only when personal information are not being collected and linked with the browser’s history information. As anticipated before, the Pragmatists users were organized in two distinct groups which we called “Personal Information Concerned ” and “Behavioral Advertising Concerned ” because of their major concerns about personally information and the risks of the behavioral advertising, respectively.

When interviewed about the comfortability of the privacy of their search engines, our participants expressed their dissatisfaction (agreement of about 17% for the non-ICT Group and only of 11% for the ICT Group). Intuitively, this comfortability is related to concerns about privacy, as feelings of comfortability

In addition, although 56% of users in the non-ICT Group and 78% of ICT users stated that they are not personally responsible for protecting their online privacy (i.e., Q13, Table IV), and more than half of all participants are aware of the tools that exist online to protect it (greater awareness for the ICT Group, p-value=0.0002), all participants do not consistently take actions to eﬀectively protect it (the whole nonICT Group aﬃrmed its inability to protect its personal information, p-value=0.0004). In general, users say that they care about privacy but they do not do anything about it.
We interviewed users about their preferences between

Page 7 of 18 ⃝c ASE 2012

search quality and search privacy. Most of the users responded for a tradeoﬀ between the two alternatives, with greater results for the Privacy ahead of Search option (rate of 61% for both groups).
To further inspect the nature of privacy concerns we analyzed responses from both groups to the following questions: “What are your main privacy concerns online?” We manually cluster ﬁve meta-categories of concern: (1) “Tracking my behaviors by third party entities”, (2) “I am worried about making ﬁnancial transactions online”, (3) “Identity theft”, (4) “Any unauthorized access to my personal information”, (5) “Internet will never forget my personal data after their dissemination”. Some answers fall in two categories and therefore the sum of columns is above 100%. Results for both groups are shown in Table VII.

We also found statistical diﬀerences between our groups about the privacy behaviors measured. Speciﬁcally, we found signiﬁcant diﬀerences across groups for “Deleting HTTP cookie” (p-value=0.0045) and “Deleting Internet ﬁles” (i.e., 0.0229). We found correlation among these two actions and privacy concerns (r=-0.3371, -0.3748, p<.05). We found diﬀerences about “Changing browser privacy settings” and about “Installing privacy tools”. We did not ﬁnd any signiﬁcant result for the “Reading of Web sites’ privacy policies” action, conﬁrming earlier ﬁndings in this ﬁeld, as discussed in Section II.
Users of the non-ICT Group are less aware of the tracking activities performed by large advertising companies to provide targeted advertising. They do not know the privacy vehicles used to track users and ﬁnally, they are less aware of the tools that exist online to protect the privacy. Finally, although aware that their browsing history may be collected for advertising purposes, most of the participants in both groups (61% of non-ICT and 56% of ICT users) are still uncomfortable, even when their personal data cannot be tied to their browsing history.
As further analysis, we can see in Fig. 4 that users who report to be slightly concerned about privacy online also report less engagement across the analyzed behaviors.

2 HOW SKILLS INFLUENCE BEHAVIORS

Some behaviors that could be indicative of a lack of privacy concern and that we studied include: (1) Increasing security settings on browsers (2) Installing tools to protect privacy (3) Deleting cookie saved on browsers (4) Deleting cache and temporary Internet ﬁles (5) Reading licence and privacy agreements. Users who are not worried about privacy typically just refrain from taking these precautions.
Our study shows that users in both groups do not change their browser privacy settings or install tools to protect privacy (Q16 and Q18, Table VIII). Only 17% of non-ICT and 61% of ICT participants regularly delete cookies and, ﬁnally, more than 70% of participants in both groups rarely/never read privacy policies (see Fig. 3 and Table VIII).

Fig. 4. Percentages of users reporting certain behaviors, grouped by level of privacy concern.
In summary, the ﬁrst part of the study showed that our respondents are highly concerned about privacy in their everyday life and that non-ICT users are more concerned than ICT ones about the privacy during online activities. We did not identify statistical diﬀerences with regards to these concerns across groups.

Our study also showed the “lazy” attitude of nonICT users who largely do not take actions to protect their privacy, highlighting a situation in which more support is needed for non-technical students (statistical results are shown in Table VIII).

As we can see from Fig. 5, on average, the posed questions were rated positively. Some lower values for the non-ICT users are relative to the complexity of the experimented tool and the low intuitiveness of the used terminology. In general, at the question “Overall, It was easy to use NoTrace” (Q27), 61% of non-ICT users expressed their agreement against 94% of ICT ones (p-value=0.0177).

Before discussing the results of the second part of the study we remind the reader that students, in this phase, were asked to use NoTrace during a 30-minutes browsing session. At the end of the testing phase, we ﬁrst collected information about users’ satisfaction and perceptions about the usability of the evaluation tool. Second, we interviewed students in order to understand if NoTrace had some eﬀect on them, in terms of increased awareness and willingness to adopt any type of strategy to improve privacy.

Fig. 5. QUIS results. Comparison between non-ICT and ICT groups.
Additionally, the ICT Group responded with more positive results than the other Group. The same trend is still valid for the analysis of results of the second questionnaire. Speciﬁcally, as we can see from Fig. 6, “Satisfaction” and “Clearness” are equally positively rated by both groups, while diﬀerences exists about easiness of use and learning and usefulness of the tool. These results conﬁrm that non-

selves against privacy invasions. Another interesting result is about the high percentage of “Neutral” users (neither concerned nor unconcerned about privacy online) who reported higher willingness against the slightly concerned users, to protect their privacy online.

by level of privacy concern.

Now we are going to analyze results about the investigation of whether a privacy-enhancing tool is able to impact on the users’ perceptions, beliefs and concerns about privacy online. The question to respond is if learning about privacy through NoTrace can involve more informed decisions about the countermeasures to adopt, and if this learning aﬀects, in the same way, both the analyzed groups.
We asked users to provide their thoughts about the concerns related to the access to their personal data and, if after using NoTrace, they were willing to take actions to protect their privacy.
Results in Table IX show positive ratings for both groups highlighting how NoTrace was able to increase user awareness about the dangers of certain activities on the Web. However, the higher positive result was for the question: “I consider important the privacy and I want to make actions and use tools to protect it” with agreement of 83% for non-ICT users and 72% of ICT users. Although all users rated positively all three questions shown in Table IX, more willingness to change their behavior online was expressed by non-ICT ones, even if we did not ﬁnd statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences.
From Fig. 7 we can see that users who report to be slightly concerned about privacy online also report less willingness to take actions to protect them-

It is worth to note that when interviewed about the possibility to reduce personal information posted on the Web, and speciﬁcally on the Facebook.com Web site, the agreement percentages, respect to the previous 2 questions (Q33 and Q34, Table IX), dropped for both groups. Even concerned about privacy, users seem not be worried about the leakage of their personal information, when some beneﬁts can be obtained in return. Some reasons, in fact, output of open-ended text questions, include: (a) “I need to add accurate information to OSNs to increase my visibility”, (b) “I need to add accurate information to OSNs to ﬁnd my old friends”, (c) “I am comfortable with how much information I share, I have a control over my personal information”.
The most important result of this part of the study is the comparative assessment between some speciﬁc questions asked before and after the tool testing phase, in order to evaluate if changes occurred in users’ opinions and habits after using a tool to protect privacy, NoTrace. Questions are shown in Table X.
When students were made informed about the potential harmful activities on the Web, and have learned by NoTrace in which way their personal information were leaked, they expressed increased concerns about risks to their privacy, especially when their data are disclosed to third party sites.

party tracking (for both groups). In Fig. 8 we can see how NoTrace involved greater concerns about privacy as well as a greater awareness about the tracking performed online by advertising companies. Additionally, in Table X we show that statistically significant diﬀerences for all questions exist only for the non-ICT users, highlighting, once again, the usefulness of NoTrace mainly for users without technological skills. For ICT users, instead, signiﬁcant results are obtained only with regard to the awareness of the tracking performed by advertising companies. Both groups increased their awareness about the risks for their privacy related to the activities performed by large advertising companies (whose concerns were expressively disclosed in open-ended questions).

VI CONCLUSION

Fig. 8. Comparison of attitudes before and after using NoTrace during the testing phase.
In general, NoTrace allowed users to understand which personal and sensitive information they disclose during their online activities, in which extent and also, towards which third party sites. Support and awareness were able to involve changes in users’ opinions, slightly increasing the level of concern about privacy in everyday life (mean values: 4.11 vs. 4.33 for the non-ICT Group and 4.17 vs. 4.28 for the ICT Group, Table X) and mostly increasing concerns about the online privacy for the non-ICT Group (3.94 vs. 4.44) and the awareness about third

In this paper we presented an evaluation study to analyze if learning from one’s behavior during online activities and awareness about who is gathering, collecting and linking personal information can help users to value their privacy and involve them to seriously take actions to protect it. To this aim we tested if a privacy-enhancing tool can contribute to increase both learning and awareness, helping users to learn from their actual behaviors, perceive what happens during their navigation, understand the corresponding risks and apply the correct countermeasures.
We evaluated that all participants equally (with no

statistical diﬀerences) consider important the privacy in everyday life, and that in general non-ICT students are more concerned about risks to their privacy online. We also showed that non-ICT students exhibit a little willingness to adopt privacy preserving technologies (i.e., install privacy tools, increase the security settings of the browsers, delete cookies and Internet ﬁles, read privacy policies) with statistical diﬀerences across groups except that for Web sites’ policies, where groups exhibited similar behaviors.

technology, can eﬀectively help individuals to value their own privacy, and reduce their degree of exposure while navigating the Web.
ACKNOWLEDGMENT
The authors would like to thank all users taking part at the study.

When learning and awareness took place, after using NoTrace, all users expressed their willingness to change their behaviors online, from one side, and their unwillingness to withhold information mainly on social network sites, on the other side. Therefore, in the compromise between privacy leakage and achievable beneﬁts for users, the winner is the need for them to make very easy their identiﬁcation and to quickly expand their friends’ community, continuing to generously provide an ever-increasing number of personal information.

Finally, we showed that NoTrace was helpful to make students aware of the risks to which they are continuously exposed during their navigation, involving changes in students’ opinions, with statistical diﬀerences for non-ICT students with regards to general concerns about privacy and for both groups with regards to the risks of the behavioral advertising. Therefore, we showed that students without technical expertise, mostly unaware of privacy risks, and with lazy attitudes to protect their privacy, learned more when compared with technological-oriented students, representing the best beneﬁciaries of the instruments provided by NoTrace.
We have to emphasize that this work has some limitations. First, all participants at our study were students from an Italian academic environment. Our samples were composed of users with high education levels and with an age ranging from 20 to 30 years. Therefore, our results may not necessarily be representative of the entire world population.
