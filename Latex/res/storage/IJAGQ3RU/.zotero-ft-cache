Abstract
The k-anonymity privacy requirement for publishing microdata requires that each equivalence class (i.e., a set of records that are indistinguishable from each other with respect to certain “identifying” attributes) contains at least k records. Recently, several authors have recognized that k-anonymity cannot prevent attribute disclosure. The notion of -diversity has been proposed to address this; diversity requires that each equivalence class has at least
well-represented values for each sensitive attribute. In this paper we show that -diversity has a number of
limitations. In particular, it is neither necessary nor sufﬁcient to prevent attribute disclosure. We propose a novel privacy notion called t-closeness, which requires that the distribution of a sensitive attribute in any equivalence class is close to the distribution of the attribute in the overall table (i.e., the distance between the two distributions should be no more than a threshold t). We choose to use the Earth Mover Distance measure for our t-closeness requirement. We discuss the rationale for t-closeness and illustrate its advantages through examples and experiments.
1. Introduction
Agencies and other organizations often need to publish microdata, e.g., medical data or census data, for research and other purposes. Typically, such data is stored in a table, and each record (row) corresponds to one individual. Each record has a number of attributes, which can be divided into the following three categories. (1) Attributes that clearly identify individuals. These are known as explicit identiﬁers and include Social Security Number, Address, and Name, and so on. (2) Attributes whose values when taken together can potentially identify an individual. These are known as quasi-identiﬁers, and may include, e.g., Zip-code, Birthdate, and Gender. (3) Attributes that are considered sensitive, such as Disease and Salary.
When releasing microdata, it is necessary to prevent the sensitive information of the individuals from being dis-

closed. Two types of information disclosure have been identiﬁed in the literature [4, 9]: identity disclosure and attribute disclosure. Identity disclosure occurs when an individual is linked to a particular record in the released table. Attribute disclosure occurs when new information about some individuals is revealed, i.e., the released data makes it possible to infer the characteristics of an individual more accurately than it would be possible before the data release. Identity disclosure often leads to attribute disclosure. Once there is identity disclosure, an individual is re-identiﬁed and the corresponding sensitive values are revealed. Attribute disclosure can occur with or without identity disclosure. It has been recognized that even disclosure of false attribute information may cause harm [9]. An observer of a released table may incorrectly perceive that an individual’s sensitive attribute takes a particular value, and behave accordingly based on the perception. This can harm the individual, even if the perception is incorrect.
While the released table gives useful information to researchers, it presents disclosure risk to the individuals whose data are in the table. Therefore, our objective is to limit the disclosure risk to an acceptable level while maximizing the beneﬁt. This is achieved by anonymizing the data before release. The ﬁrst step of anonymization is to remove explicit identiﬁers. However, this is not enough, as an adversary may already know the quasi-identiﬁer values of some individuals in the table. This knowledge can be either from personal knowledge (e.g., knowing a particular individual in person), or from other publicly-available databases (e.g., a voter registration list) that include both explicit identiﬁers and quasi-identiﬁers. A common anonymization approach is generalization, which replaces quasi-identiﬁer values with values that are less-speciﬁc but semantically consistent. As a result, more records will have the same set of quasi-identiﬁer values. We deﬁne an equivalence class of an anonymized table to be a set of records that have the same values for the quasi-identiﬁers.
To effectively limit disclosure, we need to measure the disclosure risk of an anonymized table. To this end, Samarati and Sweeney [15, 16, 18] introduced k-anonymity as the property that each record is indistinguishable with at

least k-1 other records with respect to the quasi-identiﬁer. In other words, k-anonymity requires that each equivalence class contains at least k records.
While k-anonymity protects against identity disclosure, it is insufﬁcient to prevent attribute disclosure. To address this limitation of k-anonymity, Machanavajjhala et al. [12] recently introduced a new notion of privacy, called -diversity, which requires that the distribution of a sensitive attribute in each equivalence class has at least “wellrepresented” values.
One problem with l-diversity is that it is limited in its assumption of adversarial knowledge. As we shall explain below, it is possible for an adversary to gain information about a sensitive attribute as long as she has information about the global distribution of this attribute. This assumption generalizes the speciﬁc background and homogeneity attacks used to motivate -diversity. Another problem with privacy-preserving methods in general is that they effectively assume all attributes to be categorical; the adversary either does or does not learn something sensitive. Of course, especially with numerical attributes, being close to the value is often good enough.
We propose a novel privacy notion called t-closeness that formalizes the idea of global background knowledge by requiring that the distribution of a sensitive attribute in any equivalence class is close to the distribution of the attribute in the overall table (i.e., the distance between the two distributions should be no more than a threshold t). This effectively limits the amount of individual-speciﬁc information an observer can learn. Further, in order to incorporate distances between values of sensitive attributes, we use the Earth Mover Distance metric [14] to measure the distance between the two distributions. We discuss the rationale for t-closeness and illustrate its advantages through examples and experiments.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We give an overview of -diversity in Section 2 and discuss its limitations in Section 3. We present the rationale and deﬁnition of t-closeness in Section 4, and discuss how to calculate the Earth Mover Distance in Section 5. Experimental results are presented in Section 6. Related work is discussed in Section 7. In Section 8, we discuss limitations of our approach and avenues for future research.
2. From k-Anonymity to -Diversity
The protection k-anonymity provides is simple and easy to understand. If a table satisﬁes k-anonymity for some value k, then anyone who knows only the quasi-identiﬁer values of one individual cannot identify the record corresponding to that individual with conﬁdence grater than 1/k.
While k-anonymity protects against identity disclosure, it does not provide sufﬁcient protection against attribute

disclosure. This has been recognized by several authors, e.g., [12, 19, 21]. Two attacks were identiﬁed in [12]: the homogeneity attack and the background knowledge attack.
Example 1 Table 1 is the original data table, and Table 2 is an anonymized version of it satisfying 3-anonymity. The Disease attribute is sensitive. Suppose Alice knows that Bob is a 27-year old man living in ZIP 47678 and Bob’s record is in the table. From Table 2, Alice can conclude that Bob corresponds to one of the ﬁrst three records, and thus must have heart disease. This is the homogeneity attack. For an example of the background knowledge attack, suppose that, by knowing Carl’s age and zip code, Alice can conclude that Carl corresponds to a record in the last equivalence class in Table 2. Furthermore, suppose that Alice knows that Carl has very low risk for heart disease. This background knowledge enables Alice to conclude that Carl most likely has cancer.
To address these limitations of k-anonymity, Machanavajjhala et al. [12] introduced -diversity as a stronger notion of privacy.
Deﬁnition 1 (The -diversity Principle) An equivalence class is said to have -diversity if there are at least “well-represented” values for the sensitive attribute. A table is said to have -diversity if every equivalence class of the table has -diversity.

Machanavajjhala et al. [12] gave a number of interpretations of the term “well-represented” in this principle:
1. Distinct -diversity. The simplest understanding of “well represented” would be to ensure there are at least distinct values for the sensitive attribute in each equivalence class. Distinct -diversity does not prevent probabilistic inference attacks. An equivalence class may have one value appear much more frequently than other values, enabling an adversary to conclude that an entity in the equivalence class is very likely to have that value. This motivated the development of the following two stronger notions of -diversity.
2. Entropy -diversity. The entropy of an equivalence class E is deﬁned to be
Entropy(E) = − p(E, s) log p(E, s)
s∈S
in which S is the domain of the sensitive attribute, and p(E, s) is the fraction of records in E that have sensitive value s.
A table is said to have entropy -diversity if for every equivalence class E, Entropy(E) ≥ log . Entropy diversity is strong than distinct -diversity. As pointed out in [12], in order to have entropy -diversity for each equivalence class, the entropy of the entire table must be at least log( ). Sometimes this may too restrictive, as the entropy of the entire table may be low if a few values are very common. This leads to the following less conservative notion of -diversity.
3. Recursive (c, )-diversity. Recursive (c, )-diversity makes sure that the most frequent value does not appear too frequently, and the less frequent values do not appear too rarely. Let m be the number of values in an equivalence class, and ri, 1 ≤ i ≤ m be the number of times that the ith most frequent sensitive value appears in an equivalence class E. Then E is said to have recursive (c, )-diversity if r1 < c(rl + rl+1 + ... + rm). A table is said to have recursive (c, )-diversity if all of its equivalence classes have recursive (c, )-diversity.
3. Limitations of -Diversity
While the -diversity principle represents an important step beyond k-anonymity in protecting against attribute disclosure, it has several shortcomings that we now discuss.
-diversity may be difﬁcult and unnecessary to achieve.
Example 2 Suppose that the original data has only one sensitive attribute: the test result for a particular virus. It takes two values: positive and negative. Further suppose that

there are 10000 records, with 99% of them being negative, and only 1% being positive. Then the two values have very different degrees of sensitivity. One would not mind being known to be tested negative, because then one is the same as 99% of the population, but one would not want to be known/considered to be tested positive. In this case, 2-diversity is unnecessary for an equivalence class that contains only records that are negative. In order to have a distinct 2-diverse table, there can be at most 10000×1% = 100 equivalence classes and the information loss would be large. Also observe that because the entropy of the sensitive attribute in the overall table is very small, if one uses entropy -diversity, must be set to a small value.
-diversity is insufﬁcient to prevent attribute disclosure. Below we present two attacks on -diversity.
Skewness Attack: When the overall distribution is skewed, satisfying -diversity does not prevent attribute disclosure. Consider again Example 2. Suppose that one equivalence class has an equal number of positive records and negative records. It satisﬁes distinct 2-diversity, entropy 2-diversity, and any recursive (c, 2)-diversity requirement that can be imposed. However, this presents a serious privacy risk, because anyone in the class would be considered to have 50% possibility of being positive, as compared with the 1% of the overall population.
Now consider an equivalence class that has 49 positive records and only 1 negative record. It would be distinct 2diverse and has higher entropy than the overall table (and thus satisﬁes any Entropy -diversity that one can impose), even though anyone in the equivalence class would be considered 98% positive, rather than 1% percent. In fact, this equivalence class has exactly the same diversity as a class that has 1 positive and 49 negative records, even though the two classes present very differen levels of privacy risks.
Similarity Attack: When the sensitive attribute values in an equivalence class are distinct but semantically similar, an adversary can learn important information. Consider the following example.
Example 3 Table 3 is the original table, and Table 4 shows an anonymized version satisfying distinct and entropy 3diversity. There are two sensitive attributes: Salary and Disease. Suppose one knows that Bob’s record corresponds to one of the ﬁrst three records, then one knows that Bob’s salary is in the range [3K–5K] and can infer that Bob’s salary is relatively low. This attack applies not only to numeric attributes like “Salary”, but also to categorical attributes like “Disease”. Knowing that Bob’s record belongs to the ﬁrst equivalence class enables one to conclude that Bob has some stomach-related problems, because all three diseases in the class are stomach-related.

This leakage of sensitive information occurs because while -diversity requirement ensures “diversity” of sensitive values in each group, it does not take into account the semantical closeness of these values.
Summary In short, distributions that have the same level of diversity may provide very different levels of privacy, because there are semantic relationships among the attribute values, because different values have very different levels of sensitivity, and because privacy is also affected by the relationship with the overall distribution.
4. t-Closeness: A New Privacy Measure
Intuitively, privacy is measured by the information gain of an observer. Before seeing the released table, the observer has some prior belief about the sensitive attribute value of an individual. After seeing the released table, the observer has a posterior belief. Information gain can be represented as the difference between the posterior belief and the prior belief. The novelty of our approach is that we separate the information gain into two parts: that about the whole population in the released data and that about speciﬁc individuals.
To motivate our approach, let us perform the following thought experiment: First an observer has some prior belief B0 about an individual’s sensitive attribute. Then, in a

hypothetical step, the observer is given a completely generalized version of the data table where all attributes in a quasi-identiﬁer are removed (or, equivalently, generalized to the most general values). The observer’s belief is inﬂuenced by Q, the distribution of the sensitive attribute value in the whole table, and changes to B1. Finally, the observer is given the released table. By knowing the quasi-identiﬁer values of the individual, the observer is able to identify the equivalence class that the individual’s record is in, and learn the distribution P of sensitive attribute values in this class. The observer’s belief changes to B2.
The -diversity requirement is motivated by limiting the difference between B0 and B2 (although it does so only indirectly, by requiring that P has a level of diversity). We choose to limit the difference between B1 and B2. In other words, we assume that Q, the distribution of the sensitive attribute in the overall population in the table, is public information. We do not limit the observer’s information gain about the population as a whole, but limit the extent to which the observer can learn additional information about speciﬁc individuals.
To justify our assumption that Q should be treated as public information, we observe that with generalizations, the most one can do is to generalize all quasi-identiﬁer attributes to the most general value. Thus as long as a version of the data is to be released, a distribution Q will be released.1 We also argue that if one wants to release the table at all, one intends to release the distribution Q and this distribution is what makes data in this table useful. In other words, one wants Q to be public information. A large change from B0 to B1 means that the data table contains a lot of new information, e.g., the new data table corrects some widely held belief that was wrong. In some sense, the larger the difference between B0 and B1 is, the more valuable the data is. Since the knowledge gain between B0 and B1 is about the whole population, we do not limit this gain.
We limit the gain from B1 to B2 by limiting the distance between P and Q. Intuitively, if P = Q, then B1 and B2 should be the same. If P and Q are close, then B1 and B2 should be close as well, even if B0 may be very different from both B1 and B2.
Deﬁnition 2 (The t-closeness Principle:) An equivalence class is said to have t-closeness if the distance between the distribution of a sensitive attribute in this class and the distribution of the attribute in the whole table is no more than a threshold t. A table is said to have t-closeness if all equivalence classes have t-closeness.
1Note that even with suppression, a distribution will still be released. This distribution may be slightly different from the distribution with no record suppressed; however, from our point of view, we only need to consider the released distribution and the distance of it from the ones in the equivalence classes.

Of course, requiring that P and Q to be close would also limit the amount of useful information that is released, as it limits information about the correlation between quasiidentiﬁer attributes and sensitive attributes. However, this is precisely what one needs to limit. If an observer gets too clear a picture of this correlation, then attribute disclosure occurs. The t parameter in t-closeness enables one to trade off between utility and privacy.
Now the problem is to measure the distance between two probabilistic distributions. There are a number of ways to deﬁne the distance between them. Given two distributions P = (p1, p2, ..., pm), Q = (q1, q2, ..., qm), two well-known distance measures are as follows. The variational distance is deﬁned as:
m1 D[P, Q] = 2 |pi − qi|.
i=1

And the Kullback-Leibler (KL) distance [8] is deﬁned as:

D[P, Q]

=

m
pi log
i=1

=

H(P) − H(P, Q)

where H(P) H(P, Q) =

and and

Q.

These distance measures do not reﬂect the semantic dis-

tance among values. Recall Example 3 (Tables 3 and 4),

where the overall distribution of the Income attribute is Q =

{3k, 4k, 5k, 6k, 7k, 8k, 9k, 10k, 11k}.2 The ﬁrst equiva-

lence class in Table 4 has distribution P1 = {3k, 4k, 5k} and the second equivalence class has distribution P2 = {6k, 8k, 11k}. Our intuition is that P1 results in more information leakage than P2, because the values in P1 are all in the lower end; thus we would like to have D[P1, Q] > D[P2, Q]. The distance measures mentioned above would
not be able to do so, because from their point of view values

such as 3k and 6k are just different points and have no other

semantic meaning.

In short, we have a metric space for the attribute values

so that a ground distance is deﬁned between any pair of val-

ues. We then have two probability distributions over these

values and we want the distance between the two probabil-

ity distributions to be dependent upon the ground distances

among these values. This requirement leads us to the the

Earth Mover’s distance (EMD) [14], which is actually a

Monge-Kantorovich transportation distance [5] in disguise.

The EMD is based on the minimal amount of work

needed to transform one distribution to another by moving

distribution mass between each other. Intuitively, one dis-

tribution is seen as a mass of earth spread in the space and

2We use the notation {v1, v2, · · · , vm} to denote the uniform distribution where each value in {v1, v2, · · · , vm} is equally likely.

the other as a collection of holes in the same space. EMD
measures the least amount of work needed to ﬁll the holes
with earth. A unit of work corresponds to moving a unit of
earth by a unit of ground distance.
EMD can be formally deﬁned using the well-studied transportation problem. Let P = (p1, p2, ...pm), Q = (q1, q2, ...qm), and dij be the ground distance between element i of P and element j of Q. We want to ﬁnd a ﬂow F = [fij] where fij is the ﬂow of mass from element i of P to element j of Q that minimizes the overall work:

mm

WORK (P, Q, F ) =

subject to the following constraints:

fij ≥ 0

1 ≤ i ≤ m (c2)

(c3)

These three constraints guarantee that P is transformed
to Q by the mass ﬂow F . Once the transportation problem is solved, the EMD is deﬁned to be the total work,3 i.e.,

mm

D[P, Q] = WORK (P, Q, F ) =

dij fij

i=1 j=1

We will discuss how to calculate the EMD between two distributions in Section 5. We now observe two useful facts about EMD.

Fact 1 If 0 ≤ dij ≤ 1 for all i, j, then 0 ≤ D[P, Q] ≤ 1.
The above fact follows directly from constraint (c1) and (c3). It says that if the ground distances are normalized, i.e., all distances are between 0 and 1, then the EMD between any two distributions is between 0 and 1. This gives a range from which one can choose the t value for t-closeness.

Fact 2 Given two equivalence classes E1 and E2, let P1, P2, and P be the distribution of a sensitive attribute in E1, E2, and E1 ∪ E2, respectively. Then

D[P, Q]

≤

|E1| |E1| + |E2

|

D[P1,

Q]

+

|E2| |E1| + |E2

|

D[P2,

Q]

3More generally, the EMD is the total work divided by the total ﬂow. However, since we are calculating distance between two probability distributions, the total ﬂow is always 1, as shown in formula (c3).

110

It follows that D[P, Q] ≤ max(D[P1, Q], D[P2, Q]). This means that when merging two equivalence classes, the max-
imum distance of any equivalence class from the overall distribution can never increase. Thus t-closeness is achievable for any t ≥ 0.
The above fact entails that t-closeness with EMD satisﬁes the following two properties.
Generalization Property Let T be a table, and let A and B be two generalizations on T such that A is more general than B If T satisﬁes t-closeness using B, then T also satisﬁes t-closeness using A.
Proof Since each equivalence class in A is the union of a set of equivalence classes in B and each equivalence class in B satisﬁes t-closeness, we conclude that each equivalence class in A also satisﬁes t-closeness. Thus T satisﬁes t-closeness using A.
Subset Property Let T be a table and let C be a set of attributes in T . If T satisﬁes t-closeness with respect to C, then T also satisﬁes t-closeness with respect to any set of attributes D such that D ⊂ C.
Proof Similarly, each equivalence class with respect to D is the union of a set of equivalence classes with respect to C and each equivalence class with respect to C satisﬁes t-closeness, we conclude that each equivalence class with respect to D also satisﬁes t-closeness. Thus T satisﬁes tcloseness with respect to D.
The two properties guarantee that the t-closeness using EMD measurement can be incorporated into the general
framework of the Incognito algorithm [10].

5. How to Calculate the EMD

To use t-closeness with EMD, we need to be able to calculate the EMD between two distributions. One can calculate EMD using solutions to the transportation problem, such as a min-cost ﬂow[1]; however, these algorithms do not provide an explicit formula. In the rest of this section, we derive formulas for calculating EMD for the special cases that we need to consider.
5.1. EMD for Numerical Attributes

Numerical attribute values are ordered. Let the attribute domain be {v1, v2...vm}, where vi is the ith smallest value.
Ordered Distance: The distance between two values of

is based on the number of values between them in the total

order,

i.e.,

ordered

dist(vi, vj)

=

|i−j| m−1

.

It is straightforward to verify that the ordered-distance

measure is a metric. It is non-negative and satisﬁes the

symmetry property and the triangle inequality. To calcu-

late EMD under ordered distance, we only need to consider

ﬂows that transport distribution mass between adjacent el-

ements, because any transportation between two more dis-

tant elements can be equivalently decomposed into several
transportations between adjacent elements. Based on this
observation, minimal work can be achieved by satisfying all elements of Q sequentially. We ﬁrst consider element 1, which has an extra amount of p1 − q1. Assume, without loss of generality, that p1 − q1 < 0, an amount of q1 − p1 should be transported from other elements to element 1. We can transport this from element 2. After this transportation, element 1 is satisﬁed and element 2 has an extra amount of (p1 −q1)+(p2 −q2). Similarly, we can satisfy element 2 by transporting an amount of |(p1 − q1) + (p2 − q2)| between element 2 and element 3. This process continues until element m is satisﬁed and Q is reached.
Formally, let ri = pi − qi,(i=1,2,...,m), then the distance between P and Q can be calculated as:
1 D[P, Q] = m − 1 (|r1|+|r1 +r2|+...+|r1 +r2 +...rm−1|)

1 i=m j=i

= m−1

rj

i=1 j=1

5.2. EMD for Categorical Attributes

For categorical attributes, a total order often does not exist. We consider two distance measures.
Equal Distance: The ground distance between any two value of a categorical attribute is deﬁned to be 1. It is easy to verify that this is a metric. As the distance between any two values is 1, for each point that pi − qi > 0, one just needs to move the extra to some other points. Thus we have the following formula:

1m

D[P, Q] = 2 |pi−qi| =

(pi−qi) = −

(pi−qi)

i=1

pi ≥qi

pi <qi

Hierarchical Distance: The distance between two val-
ues of a categorical attribute is based on the minimum level
to which these two values are generalized to the same value according to the domain hierarchy. Mathematically, let H be the height of the domain hierarchy, the distance between two values v1 and v2(which are leaves of the hierarchy) is deﬁned to be level (v1, v2)/H, where level(v1, v2) is the height of the lowest common ancestor node of v1 and v2. It is straightforward to verify that this hierarchical-distance
measure is also a metric. Given a domain hierarchy and two distributions P and
Q, we deﬁne the extra of a leaf node that corresponds to element i, to be pi − qi, and the extra of an internal node N to be the sum of extras of leaf nodes below N . This extra function can be deﬁned recursively as:

extra(N ) =

pi − qi

if N is a leaf

C∈Child(N) extra(C) otherwise

1-4244-0803-2/07/$20.00 ©2007 IEEE.

111

where Child(N ) is the set of all leaf nodes below node N . The extra function has the property that the sum of extra values for nodes at the same level is 0.
We further deﬁne two other functions for internal nodes:

pos extra(N ) =

|extra(C )|

C∈Child(N )∧extra(C)>0

neg extra(N ) =

|extra(C )|

C∈Child(N )∧extra(C)<0

We use cost(N ) to denote the cost of movings between N ’s children branches. An optimal ﬂow moves exactly extra(N ) in/out of the subtree rooted at N . Suppose that pos extra(N ) > neg extra, then extra(N ) = pos extra(N ) − neg extra(N ) and extra(N ) needs to move out. (This cost is counted in the cost of N ’s parent node.) In addition, one has to move neg extra among the
children nodes to even out all children branches; thus,

cost(N )

=

height(N ) H

min(pos

extra(N ), neg

extra(N ))

Then the earth mover’s distance can be written as:

D[P, Q] = N cost(N ) where N is a non-leaf node.

5.3 Analysis of t-Closeness with EMD

We now revisit Example 3 in Section 3, to show how t-
closeness with EMD handles the difﬁculties of -diversity. Recall that Q = {3k, 4k, 5k, 6k, 7k, 8k, 9k, 10k, 11k}, P1 = {3k, 4k, 5k}, and P2 = {6k, 8k, 11k}. We calculate D[P1, Q] and D[P2, Q] using EMD. Let v1 = 3k, v2 = 4k, ...v9 = 11k, we deﬁne the distance between vi and vj to be |i − j|/8, thus the maximal distance is 1. We have D[P1, Q] = 0.375,4 and D[P2, Q] = 0.167.
For the disease attribute, we use the hierarchy in Fig-
ure 1 to deﬁne the ground distances. For example, the distance between “Flu” and “Bronchitis” is 1/3, the distance between “Flu”and “Pulmonary embolism” is 2/3, and the distance between “Flu” and “Stomach cancer” is 3/3 = 1. Then the distance between the distribution {gastric ulcer, gastritis, stomach cancer} and the overall distribution is 0.5 while the distance between the distribution {gastric ulcer, stomach cancer, pneumonia} is 0.278.

We note that t-closeness protects against attribute disclosure, but does not deal with identity disclosure. Thus, it may be desirable to use both t-closeness and k-anonymity at the same time. Further, it should be noted that t-closeness deals with the homogeneity and background knowledge attacks on k-anonymity not by guaranteeing that they can never occur, but by guaranteeing that if such attacks can occur, then similar attacks can occur even with a fully-generalized table. As we argued earlier, this is the best one can achieve if one is to release the data at all.
6. Experiments
The main goals of the experiments are to study the effect of Similarity Attack on real data and to investigate the performance implications of the t-closeness approach in terms of efﬁciency and data quality.
The dataset used in the experiments is the adult dataset from the UC Irvine machine learning repository, which is comprised of data collected from the US census. We used nine attributes of the dataset, as shown in Figure 2. Records with missing values are eliminated and there are 30162 valid records in total. We use our Java implementation of the Incognito [10] algorithm. The experiments are run on a 3.4GHZ Pentium 4 machine with 2GB memory.
Similarity Attack We use the ﬁrst 7 attributes as the quasiidentiﬁer and treat Occupation as the sensitive attribute. We divide the 14 values of the Occupation attribute into three roughly equal-size groups, based on the semantic closeness of the values. Any equivalence class that has all values falling in one group is viewed as vulnerable to the similarity attack. We use Incognito to generate all entropy 2-diversity tables. In total, there are 21 minimal tables and 13 of them suffers from the Similarity attack. In one table, a total of 916 records can be inferred about their sensitive value class. We

also generate all 26 minimal recursive (4, 4)-diversity tables, and found that 17 of which are vulnerable to the similarity attack.
Efﬁciency We compare the efﬁciency and data quality of ﬁve privacy measures: (1) k-anonymity; (2) entropy -diversity; (3) recursive (c, ) diversity; (4) k-anonymity with t-closeness(t = 0.2); and (5) k-anonymity with tcloseness(t = 0.15).
Results of efﬁciency experiments are shown in Figure 3. Again we use the Occupation attribute as the sensitive attribute. Figure 3(a) shows the running times with ﬁxed k = 5, = 5 and varied quasi-identiﬁer size s, where 2 ≤ s ≤ 7. A quasi-identiﬁer of size s consists of the ﬁrst s attributes listed in Table 2. Figure 3(b) shows the running times of the ﬁve privacy measures with the same quasi-identiﬁer but with different parameters for k and . As shown in the ﬁgures, entropy -diversity run faster than the other four measures; the difference gets larger when increases. This is because with large , entropy -diversity prunes the search lattice earlier.
Data Quality Our third set of experiments compare the data quality of the ﬁve privacy measures using the discernibility metric [2] and Minimal Average Group Size [10, 15].

The ﬁrst metric measures the number of records that are indistinguishable from each other. Each record in an equivalence class of size t gets a penalty of t while each suppressed tuple gets a penalty equal to the total number of records. The second metric is the average size of the equivalence classes generated by the anonymization algorithm.
We use the 7 regular attributes as the quasi-identiﬁer and Occupation as the sensitive attribute. We set different parameters for k, , and compare the resulted dataset produced by different measurements. Figure 4 summarizes the results. We found that entropy -diversity tables has worse data quality than the other measurements. We also found that the data quality of k-anonymous tables without tcloseness is slightly better than k-anonymous tables with tcloseness. This is because t-closeness requirement provides extra protection to sensitive values and the cost is decreased data quality. When choosing t = 0.2, the degradation in data quality is minimal.
7. Related Work
The problem of information disclosure has been studied extensively in the framework of statistical databases. A number of information disclosure limitation techniques [3] have been designed for data publishing, including Sampling, Cell Suppression, Rounding, and Data Swapping and Perturbation. These techniques, however, compromised data integrity of the tables. Samarati and Sweeney [15, 16, 18] introduced the k-anonymity approach and used generalization and suppression techniques to preserve information truthfulness. Numerous algorithms [2, 6, 11, 10, 16, 17] have been proposed to achieve k-anonymity requirement. Optimal k-anonymity has been proved to be NP-hard for k ≥ 3 [13].
Recently, a number of authors have recognized that kanonymity does not prevent attribute disclosure, e.g., [12, 19, 21]. Machanavajjhala et al. [12] proposed -diversity. As we discuss in detail in Section 3, while -diversity is an important step beyond k-anonymity, it has a number of limitations. Xiao and Tao [21] observe that -diversity can-

not prevent attribute disclosure, when multiple records in the table corresponds to one individual. They proposed to have each individual specify privacy policies about his or her own attributes. We identify limitations of -diversity even when each record corresponds to one individual and proposes t-closeness, an alternative privacy measure without the need for individual policies. Xiao and Tao [20] proposed Anatomy, an data anonymization approach that divides one table into two for release; one table includes original quasi-identiﬁer and a group id, and the other include the association between the group id and the sensitive attribute values. Anatomy uses -diversity as the privacy measure; we believe that t-closeness can be used to provide more meaningful privacy.
In the current proceedings, Koudas et al. [7] examine the anonymization problem from the perspective of answering downstream aggregate queries. They develop a new privacy-preserving framework based not on generalization, but on permutations. Their work, like ours, addresses the problem of dealing with attributes deﬁned on a metric space; their approach is to lower bound the range of values of a sensitive attribute in a group.

8. Conclusions and Future Work
While k-anonymity protects against identity disclosure, it does not provide sufﬁcient protection against attribute disclosure. The notion of -diversity attempts to solve this problem by requiring that each equivalence class has at least
well-represented values for each sensitive attribute. We have shown that -diversity has a number of limitations and have proposed a novel privacy notion called t-closeness, which requires that the distribution of a sensitive attribute in any equivalence class is close to the distribution of the attribute in the overall table (i.e., the distance between the two distributions should be no more than a threshold t). One key novelty of our approach is that we separate the information gain an observer can get from a released data table into two parts: that about all population in the released data and that about speciﬁc individuals. This enables us to limit only the second kind of information gain. We use the Earth Mover Distance measure for our t-closeness requirement; this has the advantage of taking into consideration the semantic closeness of attribute values. Below we discuss some interesting open research issues.

present additional challenges. Suppose we have two sensitive attributes U and V . One can consider the two attributes separately, i.e., an equivalence class E has t-closeness if E has t-closeness with respect to both U and V . Another approach is to consider the joint distribution of the two attributes. To use this approach, one has to choose the ground distance between pairs of sensitive attribute values. A simple formula for calculating EMD may be difﬁcult to derive, and the relationship between t and the level of privacy becomes more complicated.
Other Anonymization Techniques t-closeness allows us to take advantage of anonymization techniques other than generalization of quasi-identiﬁer and suppression of records. For example, instead of suppressing a whole record, one can hide some sensitive attributes of the record; one advantage is that the number of records in the anonymized table is accurate, which may be useful in some applications. Because this technique does not affect quasiidentiﬁers, it does not help achieve k-anonymity and hence has not been considered before. Removing a value only decreases diversity; therefore, it does not help to achieve -diversity. However, in t-closeness, removing an outlier may smooth a distribution and bring it closer to the overall distribution. Another possible technique is to generalize a sensitive attribute value, rather than hiding it completely. An interesting question is how to effectively combine these techniques with generalization and suppression to achieve better data quality.
Limitations of using EMD in t-closeness The t-closeness principle can be applied using other distance measures. While EMD is the best measure we have found so far, it is certainly not perfect. In particular, the relationship between the value t and information gain is unclear. For example, the EMD between the two distributions (0.01, 0.99) and (0.11, 0.89) is 0.1, and the EMD between (0.4, 0.6) and (0.5, 0.5) is also 0.1. However, one may argue that the change between the ﬁrst pair is much more signiﬁcant than that between the second pair. In the ﬁrst pair, the probability of taking the ﬁrst value increases from 0.01 to 0.11, a 1000% increase. While in the second pair, the probability increase is only 25%. In general, what we need is a measure that combines the distance-estimation properties of the EMD with the probability scaling nature of the KL distance.
