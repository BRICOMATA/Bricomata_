Keywords: Social networking sites (SNSs) Facebook Privacy Self-disclosure

abstract
In recent years, social networking sites have spread rapidly, raising new issues in terms of privacy and self-disclosure online. For a better understanding of how privacy issues determine self-disclosure, a model which includes privacy awareness, privacy social norms, privacy policy, privacy control, privacy value, privacy concerns and self-disclosure was built. A total of 661 respondents participated in an online survey and a structural equation modeling was used to evaluate the model. The ﬁndings indicated a signiﬁcant relationship between privacy value/privacy concerns and self-disclosure, privacy awareness and privacy concerns/self-disclosure, privacy social norms and privacy value/self-disclosure, privacy policy and privacy value/privacy concerns/self-disclosure, privacy control and privacy value/privacy concerns. The model from the study should contribute new knowledge concerning privacy issues and their shaping of self-disclosure on social networking sites. It could also help networking sites service providers understand how to encourage users to disclose more information.

1. Introduction
Social networking sites (SNSs) have become an important form of communication and have been a topic of interest for researchers in the last few years in a number of disciplines including technology, communications and sociology. SNSs were deﬁned as services where (1) users can form public or semi-public proﬁles; (2) connect with other users; and (3) view lists of connections of their connections (boyd & Ellison, 2007). The SNS Facebook has all of the above-mentioned features. Users have their public proﬁles opened or closed, they interact with friends on Facebook and they can see the activities of friends and strangers on Facebook, depending on the openness of the user’s proﬁle.
This research addresses privacy issues and self-disclosure on Facebook. Privacy has been deﬁned as a personal boundary regulation process to regulate the levels of privacy with others, depending on the context (Altman, 1975; Laufer & Wolfe, 1977). Self-disclosure was deﬁned as the act of revealing personal information to others (Archer, 1980).
The motivation to start this study is years of interest in privacy issues and disclosure of personal information on SNSs, especially Facebook. Facebook was founded in 2004 and became the most popular SNS in 2009 (Cheung, Chiu, & Lee, 2011; Sheldon, 2008). As of September 2014, Facebook reported having 1.35 billion

monthly active users (Facebook.com, 2014), which is about 18% of the world population (Worldometer.info, 2014). With that many people using Facebook every day, it is important to research privacy issues and self-disclosure levels of members of Facebook.
Studies researching privacy issues and self-disclosure on Facebook have already been published, but to the best of our knowledge, no studies examined the complex set of privacy issues and their effect on self-disclosure on Facebook. This study intends to ﬁll this gap in research with a more comprehensive view of privacy and self-disclosure on SNSs by developing a model of relationships between different constructs.
The results of a survey on privacy concerns have shown that the more the users understand how their information is shared on Facebook, the more often they visit the SNS (Staddon, Huffaker, Brown, & Sedley, 2012). Another study has shown that some users are keen on SNSs, but are unfavorable to publishing things on SNSs on their own (McKnight, Lankton, & Tripp, 2011). A study reported that people are very unconﬁdent about changing the privacy settings of their Facebook account and that 95% of frequent users of Facebook have changed their status update at least once a month (boyd & Hargittai, 2010). Another study on Internet users also reported that some users had inaccurate perceptions of their knowledge on privacy (Jensen, Potts, & Jensen, 2005).
Our research aims to establish a connection between privacyrelated issues and self-disclosure. A set of constructs was selected for the model developed in this study. Privacy awareness, privacy social norms, privacy policy and privacy control are independent constructs. Privacy awareness measures to which extent users

are informed about privacy problems, violations and procedures in SNSs. Privacy social norms measure how other people or friends inﬂuence the users on keeping their information private on SNSs. Privacy policy measures how the users feel how the privacy policy of SNSs reﬂects the protection of their privacy and conﬁdentiality of their information. Privacy control measures how much control do the users believe they have over who can access information on their proﬁles.
Constructs that are inﬂuenced by the above-mentioned constructs are privacy value, privacy concerns and self-disclosure. Privacy value measures how users feel about privacy, privacy threats and the importance of maintaining their privacy. Privacy concerns measure if the users are concerned about who will have access to the information they put on SNSs. Self-disclosure measures to what extent the users’ proﬁles are ﬁlled with their personal information and how much information users reveal on Facebook.
The research model that was developed based on the abovedescribed constructs will examine the relationships between the constructs by using structural equation modeling (SEM). Factor analysis, structural equations (regression) and path analysis are modeled in a picture for a clearer conceptualization in SEM (Byrne, 2010). The purpose of SEM is to assess model ﬁt and the hypotheses of the research. The population of this study were Slovenian users of Facebook, aged between 18 and 65 and the sample was 661 users who ﬁlled out an online survey (administered using LimeSurvey).
The contributions of this study will be new knowledge concerning privacy issues and its inﬂuence on self-disclosure on SNSs. The study will also help SNSs providers understand how to get their users to disclose more information and inform the media about privacy issues that are important for users when disclosing information on SNSs.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 focuses on a review of existing literature on the subject and a theoretical foundation where selected works on privacy issues and self-disclosure are discussed. Section 3 deﬁnes the research model and hypothesis. The constructs used in the model are discussed. Section 4 explains data collection and who the participants of the survey were. It also explains the measures for the model, while Section 5 analyzes the data and presents the results. The paper concludes with Section 6, which includes a discussion and the practical implications of the ﬁndings.
2. Literature review and theoretical development
2.1. Privacy, self-disclosure and SNSs
Privacy issues among SNSs have already been the topic of research for many studies. A study done among college students during the early rise of Facebook showed that the social factor (friends having closed proﬁles) and time spent on SNS (more time) had an inﬂuence on more privately set proﬁles of users on Facebook (Lewis, Kaufman, & Christakis, 2008). Another study explained that the users of Facebook applications misunderstood what data the applications were gathering about them and that users were not always consistent with their privacy concerns (King, Lampinen, & Smolen, 2011). Sahinoglu, Akkaya, and Ang (2012) analyzed privacy and security risks for SNSs users and demonstrated how to manage those risks. Anderson and Stajano (2013) discussed how SNSs come into conﬂict with privacy, proposing a new architecture in order for users to have better control over their data. In a study by Frampton and Child (2013) participants indicated that mostly they primarily added their coworkers on Facebook, but that it also depended on the participants’ privacy management practices. Feng and Xie (2014) found that (1) parents’ educational inﬂuence, and (2) frequent SNS use are motivators for

teens to increase their privacy concerns and disclose less information on Facebook.
Self-disclosure on SNSs has also been researched in the past. Chang and Heo (2014) explored the factors that could inﬂuence information disclosure on Facebook, some of the factors being also time spent on Facebook, number of friends, perceived risks, and beneﬁts. Different motives for Facebook use were explained by Special and Li-Barber (2012), some of them being passing time, entertainment and relationship maintenance. Hollenbaugh and Ferris (2014) similarly found factors inﬂuencing self-disclosure, some of them being social cohesion, Facebook motives and personality factors. Also Kwak, Choi, and Lee (2014) researched factors inﬂuencing self-disclosure on Facebook, some of them being enjoyment, curiosity and time-distortion.
There has been also research done on privacy and self-disclosure on SNSs, but not into the ways that privacy issues affect self-disclosure on Facebook. In the early stages of Facebook, research showed that individuals disclosed information almost irrespective of their privacy concerns (Acquisti & Gross, 2006; Gross & Acquisti, 2005). Kolek and Saunders (2008) found that many students did not have their Facebook accounts protected with restricted access, allowing random people to see their addresses or personal pictures. Another study found that users of Facebook knew how to manage their privacy controls, but were sometimes unaware of who the audience of their published posts will be (Johnson, Egelman, & Bellovin, 2012). Stutzman, Gross, and Acquisti (2012) also conducted privacy and disclosure research over time and explained that users have revealed more information and cared about privacy less within six years’ time from the beginning to the end of the research. Taddei and Contena (2013) developed a model where they also indicated the direct effect of privacy concerns on self-disclosure behaviors on Facebook.
2.2. Communications privacy management and SNSs
The theory that was used as a baseline for the formation of the research model is the Communication Privacy Management (CPM) theory proposed by Petronio (2002). CPM deﬁnes privacy as the process of opening and closing boundaries to others. First, the ownership of the information is important in CPM, where the coownership rights for private information is extended to other users when individuals share their private information. The ownership is only transmitted when the information is shared with the owner’s permission, not when it is taken without permission. Secondly, the control of private information is important for individuals in CPM theory, meaning that when individuals disclose information, they want the option of revealing or concealing private information. And thirdly, turbulence in CPM is considered to be when some information that should not be shared, has nevertheless been shared without the owner’s permission. In the context of SNSs, users of Facebook can control, who has access to the information they publish and when they publish the information, their friends can also share their information further.
The CPM theory has been primarily used in interpersonal, family and health communications (Petronio & Durham, 2014), but it can also be found in the research of privacy and disclosure on SNSs (Courtney Walton & Rice, 2013; De Wolf, Willaert, & Pierson, 2014; Frampton & Child, 2013; Kisekka, Bagchi-Sen, & Rao, 2013; Lee, Park, & Kim, 2013). In the next section privacy and self-disclosure models are presented, some of them also based on CPM theory.
2.3. Privacy and self-disclosure models
In our study, we have included previous research that was found most suitable for explaining the relationship between privacy issues constructs and self-disclosure on Facebook. During this

160

research, no paper with the same or similar model proposal was found. A summary of variables, user groups and references for all the papers that were thoroughly analyzed before developing the research model is in Table 1.
Dinev and Hart (2004) established the impact of perceived vulnerability and perceived ability to control on perceived privacy concerns, which was further divided into information ﬁnding and information abuse. An exploratory factor analysis supported the validity of the measures while a regression model analysis indicated that there is additional space for expanding the model with more constructs while doing further empirical research. The perceived ability to control had a non-signiﬁcant, while perceived vulnerability had a signiﬁcant and positive effect on information ﬁnding and information abuse, which are both part of perceived privacy concerns.
Xu, Dinev, Smith, and Hart (2008) proposed a model of formation of users privacy concerns – the study examines a complex set of privacy issues and was tested on users of e-commerce, social networking, ﬁnance and healthcare websites. The model is based on CPM theory. Partial least squares (PLS) analysis and hypotheses testing revealed 49% of the variance for social networking site users in the model. The model empirically supports the understanding of the formation of an individual’s privacy concerns. The direct effects on privacy concerns are the perception of intrusion, privacy risk and privacy control, while the disposition to privacy has a direct effect on all three mentioned constructs. There is also a signiﬁcant effect for the perceived effectiveness of privacy policy on privacy risk and privacy control. The privacy seal has a non-signiﬁcant effect on privacy risk and a signiﬁcantly positive effect on privacy control. Privacy awareness has a non-signiﬁcant effect, whereas privacy social norms have a signiﬁcantly positive effect on the disposition for privacy.
A paper on self-disclosure on SNSs by Krasnova, Kolesnikova, and Guenther (2009) presented a SEM model, tested on SNS users. The model indicated the connections between the proposed constructs. The model implied that the users cared about their privacy less than they should and that perceived enjoyment has a signiﬁcantly positive and privacy concerns have a signiﬁcantly negative impact on self-disclosure among SNSs. Wu, Huang, Yen, and Popova (2012) similarly researched the effect of online privacy policy on the willingness to provide personal information on websites mediated by consumer’s privacy concern and trust. The privacy policy construct was further divided into notice, choice, access, security and enforcement and the impact of all individual connections on online privacy concern and trust was examined. The paper showed relationships between the constructs, also indicating the

negative effect of privacy concerns on willingness to provide personal information.
Xu, Gupta, Rosson, and Carroll (2012) measured the information privacy concern of mobile users and developed a model, where the information privacy concern has sub constructs, which are: the secondary use of personal information, perceived surveillance and perceived intrusion. The model conﬁrms that prior privacy experience has a negative impact on information privacy concern and that information privacy concern has a positive effect on behavioral intention, which also measures the disclosure of personal information on mobile applications.
Chen (2013) analyzed privacy self-disclosure behaviors among SNS users and proposed a theoretical model, indicating the impact of extroversion, perceived critical mass and perceived Internet risk on privacy self-disclosure behaviors, mediated by attitude. It also indicates that privacy value reduces the impact of attitude on privacy self-disclosure behaviors.
The model presented in this paper is based on the models in Table 1. When conducting this research we selected privacy awareness, privacy social norms, privacy policy, privacy value, privacy concerns, privacy control and self-disclosure constructs for building our model. These are the constructs that appeared in the described privacy and self-disclosure models often and already indicated some effects between oneself.
The dependent variables self-disclosure in our model have different antecedent variables in the models presented in Table 1 then in our proposed model. The self-disclosure antecedents in the models presented were privacy concerns, trust and attitude. Privacy concerns were indicated to have a signiﬁcant negative impact on self-disclosure in papers by Krasnova et al. (2009) and Wu et al. (2012). Trust has a signiﬁcantly positive impact on self-disclosure (Wu et al., 2012) while attitude also has a signiﬁcantly positive impact on self-disclosure, although it is weakened by privacy value (Chen, 2013).
There are no antecedents for the privacy value variable in researched models whereas our model proposes this variable as a mediator variable. The variable privacy concerns is also a mediator variable in our model and there are different antecedents predicting this variable in researched models. Dinev and Hart (2004) indicated that perceived vulnerability and the ability to control have an impact on privacy concerns. The model by Xu et al. (2008) indicates the positive impact of perception of intrusion and privacy risk and negative impact of privacy control on privacy concerns. Krasnova et al. (2009) indicated the positive impact of perceived likelihood and perceived damage on privacy concerns for SNSs users. Wu et al. (2012) indicated the negative impact of privacy

policy access, security and enforcement on online privacy concerns, and did not ﬁnd any signiﬁcant impact for privacy policy notice and choice on online privacy concerns. Xu et al. (2012) indicated the negative impact of prior privacy experiences on mobile users’ information privacy concern.
The independent variables in our model are privacy awareness, privacy social norms, privacy policy and privacy control. The constructs privacy awareness and privacy social norm have no antecedents in analyzed studies, but the latter has signiﬁcantly positive impact on disposition to privacy (Xu et al., 2008). Privacy policy construct is also explained in the same paper as the perceived effectiveness of privacy policy and has a positive impact on privacy control and negative impact on privacy risk. And privacy control is explained by perceived effectiveness of privacy policy and seal, both having a positive impact on privacy control. Privacy policy construct is also explained by Wu et al. (2012), divided into notice, choice, access, security and enforcement and indicated impact on trust and online privacy concerns.
Our model is based on previously developed models that were tested not only on SNSs users, but also on general Internet users, website users and mobile users. The primary goal of this paper was to develop a model for SNSs users with the analysis of how privacy effects on self-disclosure.
3. Research model and hypotheses
The research model of this study is presented in Fig. 1, and was developed based on previous research on privacy issues and selfdisclosure online. It was developed from the CPM theory and models, both presented in the previous section. The constructs selected for this model were selected by frequency of appearance and indicated signiﬁcance of paths in existing models.
While controlling for gender, age and education, the model in Fig. 1 proposes that privacy awareness, privacy social norms, privacy policy and privacy control have a direct impact on privacy value, privacy concerns and self-disclosure. Furthermore, the model proposes that all four independent variables are interrelated to each other. Moreover, the model also proposes that privacy value and privacy concerns have a direct impact on self-disclosure on Facebook. Below all the constructs in the research model are discussed in more detail, followed by the hypotheses.
3.1. Privacy value
Privacy value is an important topic in SNSs, explaining how users feel about privacy, privacy threats and the importance of maintaining their privacy. A study on information disclosure

showed that some users do not worry about posting their personal information, but most users do worry about their identity on Facebook, which also inﬂuences their level of self-disclosure (Tow, Dell, & Venable, 2010). Acquisti and Gross (2006) carried out research among undergraduate students and the mean on a 7-point Likert scale for members of Facebook, when asked how concerned they were about threats to their personal privacy, was 4.81 whereas for non-members of Facebook it was 5.41. This implies that, already in the early days of the Facebook site, non-members were more aware of privacy threats, and consequentially had a higher privacy value. Chen (2013) reported that privacy value attenuates the relationship between attitude and privacy self-disclosure behaviors on SNSs.
The literature suggests that privacy value and self-disclosure are two strongly related constructs. Therefore, this study proposes the following hypotheses:
H1. Privacy value has a positive impact on self-disclosure on SNSs.
3.2. Privacy concerns
The privacy concerns construct is a widely used construct in the research of privacy and users behavior associated with privacy concerns. Information that the user puts on SNS is collected by Facebook and the users are often not acquainted with this, although media is increasing the awareness of information collected by Facebook. CPM indicates that when people have higher privacy concerns, they will want to more strictly manage their disclosed information (Petronio, 2002). A study showed that the mean for the statement of how users felt if a stranger would know where they lived was 5.78 on a 7-point Likert scale. Number 7 was labeled as being ‘‘very worried’’ and was chosen by 46% of respondents (Acquisti & Gross, 2006). Another study revealed that 56% of Internet users have concerns about online privacy (Paine, Reips, Stieger, Joinson, & Buchanan, 2007). A study on risk taking, trust and privacy concerns among SNSs implied that non-SNS users are more concerned about the consequences of sharing identity information than SNS users and that SNS users are more likely to share their identity information online in the future than non-SNS users (Fogel & Nehmad, 2009). Furthermore, a study where interviews with students who use Facebook were held presented answers where students revealed that they did not want to have their information exposed on Facebook because of concerns about, who could access this information (Young & Quan-Haase, 2009).
According to a model where the effect of privacy concerns on willingness to provide personal information was examined, the

162

negative impact between the constructs was indicated (Wu et al., 2012). Another study on self-disclosure for SNSs indicated the negative relationship between privacy concerns and self-disclosure (Krasnova et al., 2009).
Based on previous research, the impact of privacy concerns on self-disclosure is supported and the research shows that the more users are concerned about privacy, the less information they are going to disclose on SNSs. Therefore, this study proposes the following hypotheses:
H2. Privacy concerns have a negative impact on self-disclosure on SNSs.
3.3. Privacy awareness
Privacy awareness is a construct that measures how much a person is informed about privacy practices in SNSs. Media coverage plays an important part in raising privacy awareness (Dinev & Hart, 2006). Research conducted in 2009 and 2010 showed that students became more and more aware of privacy issues on Facebook in the time between the two studies (boyd & Hargittai, 2010). Another study done among students also showed that 10.3% of students in the study were unaware of their privacy settings on Facebook (Nemec, Brumen, Welzer, & Hölbl, 2011). A study on social phishing also found that SNSs users were more keen on giving information to someone who seemed to be a real-life friend than to strangers, suggesting that the collaborators of this study were aware of potential threats (Jagatic, Johnson, Jakobsson, & Menczer, 2007).
The literature suggests that privacy awareness is related to selfdisclosure, privacy value and privacy concerns. This study proposes the following hypotheses:
H3a. Privacy awareness has a negative impact on self-disclosure.
H3b. Privacy awareness has a positive impact on privacy value.
H3c. Privacy awareness has a negative impact on privacy concerns.

H4b. Privacy social norms have a positive impact on privacy value.
H4c. Privacy social norms have a positive impact on privacy concerns.
3.5. Privacy policy
Privacy policy is a construct that incorporates users’ opinions on how their privacy is protected with regards to SNS privacy policy and if their information is conﬁdential. Acquisti and Gross (2006) tested the users’ opinions on the importance of privacy policy on a 7-point Likert scale and the mean was 5.41, meaning it is highly important. Also the users who are more acquainted with the privacy policy of a website tend to disclose less information (Stutzman, Capra, & Thompson, 2011). A model tested by Xu et al. (2008) also indicated that privacy policy increases individuals’ perceived privacy control. In another study of the privacy practices of Internet users, 86% of the respondents did not read the privacy policy of websites that do not ask any information from them and 43% of users re-check the privacy policy before buying anything online (Jensen et al., 2005). Stutzman et al. (2011) indicated a negative impact for privacy policy consumption on disclosure on Facebook, meaning that the people who read more of the privacy policy will disclose less information. Wu et al. (2012) indicated a negative impact for privacy policy on online privacy concerns among Internet users.
As explained in the literature, previous research suggests that privacy policy has had an inﬂuence on self-disclosure, privacy values and privacy concerns. This study proposes the following hypotheses:
H5a. Privacy policy has a negative impact on self-disclosure.
H5b. Privacy policy has a negative impact on privacy value.
H5c. Privacy policy has a negative impact on privacy concerns.
3.6. Privacy control

3.4. Privacy social norms
Privacy social norms is a construct that incorporates how other people or friends inﬂuence the user into keeping their information privacy. Altman (1977) already indicated cultural effect on individuals privacy. Laufer and Wolfe (1977) suggested that public opinion is very important for privacy value. Another study also suggested that users change their privacy on Facebook depending on what they perceive others are expecting (Christoﬁdes, Muise, & Desmarais, 2009). The results of a study by Camacho, Minelli, and Grosseck (2012) showed that 26% of participants were somewhat inﬂuenced by their contacts on SNS and 46% of the respondents claimed not to be inﬂuenced by their contacts on SNS. A study with a model of individuals’ privacy concerns has also indicated a positive effect for privacy social norms on privacy value (Xu et al., 2008).
Evidence was found in the literature that privacy social norms is an important construct and is related to self-disclosure, privacy value and privacy concerns. Therefore, this study proposes the following hypotheses:
H4a. Privacy social norms have a negative impact on selfdisclosure.

Privacy control is a construct widely used in privacy models. It explains how much control users have over who can see their information. CPM implies that the possibility of managing private information should be possible. For example, when an individual’s relationship with a friend on Facebook changes, they might change the privacy settings of their disclosed information or even unfriend someone (Petronio & Durham, 2014). Studies have determined that it is necessary to have individual and group privacy rules to gain better control over the data (De Wolf et al., 2014; Petronio, 2002). A collaborator in research by Wang et al. (2011) explained that he has created another account on Facebook to self-check how others see his account even though Facebook has a feature of checking the proﬁle from a different user already integrated. Dinev and Hart (2004) and Xu et al. (2008) indicated a negative relationship between the perceived ability to control and privacy concerns. Another study also showed that 71% of mobile SNS users would prefer determining who can access the information they share (Christin, Sánchez López, Reinhardt, Hollick, & Kauer, 2013).
As explained in other studies, privacy control has an inﬂuence on self-disclosure, privacy values and privacy concerns. Therefore, this study proposes the following hypotheses:
H6a. Privacy control has a negative impact on self-disclosure.

H6b. Privacy control has a negative impact on privacy value.
H6c. Privacy control has a negative impact on privacy concerns. In the following chapters we will describe the research methods
used in this survey, data analysis and the results of the study.

from (1) strongly disagree to (5) strongly agree was used to evaluate the items in each construct. The detailed constructs with items and references used to build the constructs are in Table 3. There were 26 items in the survey. The survey instruments were pretested with 25 users of Facebook and then reﬁned and validated for statistical properties.

4. Research methods
The study used an online questionnaire that was designed to test 14 hypotheses. Survey questions measuring each construct – privacy awareness, privacy social norms, privacy policy, privacy control, privacy value, privacy concerns and self-disclosure – were designed based on existing literature and discussion with fellow faculty members.
4.1. Data collection and participants
This research targeted users of Facebook in Slovenia. Facebook penetration in Slovenia was 39.9% in May 2014 (Allin1Social.com, 2014). On average there are 50% male and 50% female users and the majority of Facebook users in Slovenia are between 18 and 44 years old, while the largest group are users aged between 25 and 34 years old (29.6%), followed by the age group 18 to 24 (24.7%) and the age group 35 to 44 (19.0%) (SocialBakers.com, 2014).
The participants of this particular study were aged between 18 and 65. A convenience sampling was used to recruit the participants, posting a call for participation on different Facebook groups, web forums and sent via e-mail to researcher’s home institution students. The welcome page of the questionnaire notiﬁed the participants about the title of the research, protection of their data and their treatment. There were 47 questions in total in the survey.
The total number of participants was 828. After a case screening 155 cases were excluded, because they did not use Facebook. Also if the standard deviation for responses of each person were less than 0.5, the case was excluded, because there is no variance in these cases. A total of 12 such unengaged responses were deleted. The variables age and education were tested for outliers with boxplots and no cases were excluded after this step, because there were no outliers found. After the complete screening was done, 661 cases were valid. A detailed sample of demographics for valid cases is in Table 2.
4.2. Measures
Measurement items for the constructs were combined from existing measures to ensure validity. A 5-point Likert-scale ranging

5. Data analysis and results
A data analysis was performed with the use of IBM SPSS Statistics 20.0 and AMOS 19.0 software. A structural equations modeling was used and hypothesis testing was done.
5.1. Model analysis
First, variable screening for missing data was done, and then factor loadings analysis was conducted and it was iterated until the results arrived at a clean pattern matrix. Two variables, SD5 (Variable 5 for the Self-disclosure construct) and PCt3 (Variable 3 for the Privacy control construct) were dropped because of a loading lower than 0.5. Two variables with a loading lower than 0.5 were left in the model to avoid under-dependency, which may occur when there are not enough items to deﬁne a construct (Hair, 2010). Altogether 24 items were left in the model.
Convergent validity was evaluated with Cronbach’s alpha, a commonly used measure testing the extent to which multiple items for a construct belong together. The coefﬁcient ranges from 0 to 1. Cronbach’s alpha in the research model presented ranged from 0.711 to 0.894, which is within the acceptable reliability coefﬁcient above 0.7 (Nunnaly, 1978). Cronbach’s alpha was calculated for each construct, considering all the items that were left after the exclusion of two items. All values are presented in Table 4.
The factor loadings for the ﬁnal set of items in the model are also presented in Table 4. The bolded items in the table exceed the recommended values. The results show that the instrument of research has a high internal consistency and factor loadings and is therefore reliable.
Next, a conﬁrmatory factor analysis was done to validate the model. The results of the model ﬁt for the initial model (after two construct items were already deleted) can be seen in Table 5. The following ﬁt indices were included: the chi-square statistic (Cmin/df), the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), the goodness-of-ﬁt (GFI), the normed ﬁt index (NFI) and the comparative ﬁt index (CFI). The recommended values in the table were adapted from Segars and Grover (1993), Chin and Todd (1995) and Hair (2010).
In the resulting set of measurement items the composite reliability (CR), average variance extracted (AVE) and factor correlations matrix are presented in Table 6. The composite reliability values are between 0.737 and 0.902, and the average variance extracted values are between 0.501 and 0.677, all surpassing the minimum value of 0.7 and 0.5 respectively (Hair, 2010). The discriminant validity criteria is conﬁrmed when the AVE value exceeds the squared correlation between different constructs (Fornell & Larcker, 1981). As in Table 6, there is good discriminant validity for all constructs. To sum up, there are no reliability or validity concerns in the model.
Further on, a common method bias approach was done to deﬁne whether anything external to questions may have inﬂuenced the responses by the user (Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee, & Podsakoff, 2003). Evidence of common method bias was found in privacy policy and privacy concern factor so the common latent factor was retained in the model, meaning the model is using common method bias adjusted variables.

5.3. Testing research hypothesis
The model was tested for the overall model ﬁt, while individual paths in the model were also tested. The results of the path analysis for the links between different groups of factors are in Fig. 2.
The path coefﬁcient analysis and the results of the t-statistic explain the hypotheses that were developed. The strength and signiﬁcance of each path is evaluated by the standardized coefﬁcient (b) and by a t value higher than 2.0 or lower than À2.0 (Al Omoush, Yaseen, & Atwah Alma’aitah, 2012). The results of the path analysis and hypotheses testing are in Table 8. The results indicate that three paths are insigniﬁcant – (1) privacy awareness does not have a signiﬁcant effect on privacy value, (2) privacy control does not have a signiﬁcant relationship on self-disclosure and (3) privacy social norms do not have a signiﬁcant effect on privacy concerns. Privacy social norms and privacy control have a signiﬁcant effect on privacy value at a p value lower than 0.01 and standardized coefﬁcient values of 0.116 and À0.147 respectively, with t values higher than 3 and lower than À3 respectively. All the other path effects in the model are signiﬁcant at p lower than 0.001. Privacy concerns, privacy awareness, privacy social norms, and privacy policy have a signiﬁcant effect on self-disclosure and standardized values À0.340, À0.340, À0.125, À0.425 respectively, with t values

6. Discussion and conclusions
SNSs, particularly Facebook, are a part of the everyday life of many individuals. Facebook is gaining new members daily as well as new posts and information on proﬁles are published by users daily. The spread of SNSs has opened new issues in privacy and self-disclosure online.
The goal of the study was to develop a model of how privacy awareness, privacy social norms, privacy policy, privacy control, privacy value, privacy concerns and self-disclosure are interconnected with each other. To the best of our knowledge, it is the ﬁrst work that jointly considers all constructs in one model. The model was built based on previous research done in the ﬁeld of privacy and self-disclosure. Online methods were used to collect data to

validate the model. 661 respondents aged between 18 and 65, who both use Facebook and are from Slovenia, participated in the survey.
Our results provided an empirical model with the following constructs – privacy awareness, privacy social norms, privacy policy, privacy control, privacy value, privacy concerns and selfdisclosure, tested on users of SNS Facebook. The research model was conﬁrmed via SEM analysis and the results of the path analysis accepted 11 out of 14 hypotheses tested. Privacy awareness, privacy social norms, privacy policy, privacy values and privacy concerns were indicated as being important in affecting selfdisclosure on Facebook. The results also showed that privacy social

norms, privacy policy and privacy control have an effect on privacy value. And privacy awareness, privacy policy and privacy control have an effect on privacy concerns.
To place our results in context, privacy value was found to have a signiﬁcantly positive impact on self-disclosure on a SNS. This indicates that the higher the user will value privacy, the more the user will disclose on Facebook. In a study by Stutzman et al. (2011) a similar hypothesis was conﬁrmed, indicating that the users who had customized privacy settings for published content, were less likely to disclose more information on Facebook. A study by Lampe, Ellison, and Steinﬁeld (2008) showed that user perception could change over time, meaning that if the persons’ privacy value increases, they will want to disclose their information more carefully.
Privacy concerns were found to have a negative impact on selfdisclosure, meaning that the higher the users’ concern for privacy will be, the less information the user will disclose on SNSs. This path has already been supported by Krasnova et al. (2009) and Wu et al. (2012).
Privacy awareness was indicated to have a signiﬁcantly negative impact on self-disclosure and on privacy concerns. This means that the more the users are informed about privacy, the less they will want to self-disclose and that the privacy concerns of the users will be higher. The privacy awareness of visitors of online websites has already driven companies to deal with privacy concerns by changing privacy policies (Cranor, Egelman, Sheng, McDonald, & Chowdhury, 2008). The impact of privacy awareness on privacy value in our model was not signiﬁcant. This impact was also not signiﬁcant for social networking users in a study by Xu et al. (2008), but it was signiﬁcantly positive for the users of e-commerce, ﬁnancial and healthcare websites.
Privacy social norms were indicated to have a negative impact on self-disclosure and positive impact on privacy value. The latter relationship was also supported by Xu et al. (2008). This relationships indicate that the bigger the inﬂuence of friends in raising the privacy awareness of the user is, the less the user will disclose and the user will have a lower value of privacy. The impact of privacy social norms does not have any signiﬁcant impact on privacy concerns and this path was not presented in any other study found. This implies that the inﬂuence of friends in raising the privacy awareness of the user is not relevant for users’ privacy concerns.
Privacy policy was indicated to have a negative impact on selfdisclosure, privacy value and privacy concerns. Likewise, the ﬁrst and the last relationships were similarly supported by Stutzman et al. (2011) and Wu et al. (2012) respectively. All the indicated paths imply that the more the user will read the privacy policy, the higher control over self-disclosure the user will want to have. As well as raising the privacy value of the user, the user will also be more concerned about privacy issues when reading more of the privacy policy. Based on these results policy makers are advised to provide users with more information that can help a user understand their concerns.
Privacy control was indicated to have a negative impact on privacy value and privacy concerns. To explain, the users who feel that they have a good control over their privacy settings on Facebook will show a higher value for privacy than others and will have more concerns about the privacy as well. The impact of privacy control on self-disclosure in the proposed model was not signiﬁcant. Another study, however, implied that the impact between privacy behavior and disclosure is positive (Stutzman et al., 2011), although the privacy behavior construct is not exactly the same as the privacy control in our model. The path in our model implies that privacy control does not have any signiﬁcant effect on what the user will self-disclose.
As explained in this section, our results are consistent with previous ﬁndings from research in the ﬁeld of privacy and

self-disclosure in the majority of instances. The results conﬁrm and add new meaning to research in the ﬁeld of the formation of self-disclosure on SNSs.
6.1. Limitations and future research directions
This study has some limitations. Facebook penetration in Slovenia is 39.9% (Allin1Social.com, 2014), which is about 820,000 people. The sample size in this study was 661 Slovenian users of Facebook, which is statistically valid with a 95 conﬁdence level and 3.81% margin of error. Due to the convenience sampling method the study cannot be generalized to Slovenian users of Facebook or to all Facebook users. Future research should strive to collect a larger and more representative sample.
The next limitation were the constructs in the model. Even though an extensive analysis of existing studies was conducted, potential constructs might have been left unselected. Future studies should identify and incorporate potentially signiﬁcant constructs for privacy issues and self-disclosure.
A statistical limitation was also that common method bias was found in privacy policy and privacy concern constructs so that common latent factor was retained in the model, meaning that model used common method bias adjusted variables. Future studies should avoid using the common method bias.
Future studies may need to develop a measurement scale speciﬁc to SNS users. The constructs in this study were adapted from models with users of Internet, electronic commerce, ﬁnancial and healthcare websites, mobile users and SNS users.
6.2. Conclusion
In conclusion, this research explains the privacy dynamics behind self-disclosure on SNSs. The model presented in our study was built upon previously developed models but extended with the missing connections between privacy variables and self-disclosure among SNSs users. This model attempted to present a more holistic view on the issue of self-disclosure on Facebook and privacy variables that have a signiﬁcant impact on self-disclosure.
The contribution of this study is to better understand the privacy dynamics and self-disclosure of users on SNS Facebook, given that earlier studies have not incorporated some of the important privacy variables in self-disclosure models among Facebook users. This study combined privacy awareness, privacy social norms, privacy policy, privacy control, privacy value, privacy concerns and self-disclosure into one model. The study could help SNS providers publish more information for their users. With the media coverage of the ﬁndings of this study, a better understanding of privacy issues and self-disclosure on Facebook could also be presented. The developed model could also serve as a basis for other models to be developed and the model could also be extended to some other platform, not only SNSs.
