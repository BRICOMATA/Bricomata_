abstract
This study investigates the relationships among information security awareness, concern for information privacy, consumer alienation, privacy risk belief, lurking, and self-concealment. It explores the mediation effects of concern for information privacy/consumer alienation between information security awareness and privacy risk belief as well as the mediation effect of lurking between privacy risk belief and selfconcealment. The results conﬁrm that information security awareness has signiﬁcant and positive effects on concern for information privacy, consumer alienation, and privacy risk belief. Concerns for information privacy and consumer alienation have signiﬁcant and positive effects on privacy risk belief. Privacy risk belief has a signiﬁcant and positive effect on lurking and self-concealment. Lurking has a signiﬁcant and positive effect on self-concealment. Concerns for information privacy and consumer alienation are mediators between information security awareness and privacy risk belief. In addition, perceived privacy empowerment is a moderator between privacy risk belief and lurking as well as between privacy risk belief and self-concealment.

1. Introduction
People enjoy the growing prevalence of social networking sites' (SNSs’) communities along with their rapid popularity. SNSs not only provide an open fora for discussion but they also allow users to easily and swiftly expressing their thoughts, views, ideas, or sharing knowledge with others (Pi, Chou, & Liao, 2013). InsightXplorer (2015) indicated that SNSs are popular among Taiwanese to engage in a social networking behavior. However, they remain concerned about information security problems behind the booming development of SNSs. There are more and more incidents regarding embezzled accounts and leaking of personal private information as SNSs expand. SNSs users gradually raise their information security awareness (ISA) because of networking crime reported by the media.

SNSs users express concerns about releasing personal private information which subsequently may generate apprehension for information privacy and risk beliefs of sharing information when they experience ISA (Malhotra, Kim, & Agarwal, 2004). Consumers get alienated and enhance their concern for information privacy (CFIP) with regard to powerless (inability to affect certain market practices) and normlessness (distrust of business and market practices) because of the status quo of perceived privacy empowerment supplied by SNS providers when they become aware of information privacy problems (Schwaig, Segars, Grover, & Fiedler, 2013). Higher general privacy concerns for online consumers are reﬂected by lower self-disclosure of personal information (Li, Sarathy, & Xu, 2011), which subsequently creates a lurking behavior and conceals personal private information in a SNS. SNSs users lose their conﬁdence to get online and generate emotions that further reduce their intentions to disclose information. In turn, they gradually become lurkers because of the alienation induced by powerlessness (Ahn, Kwolek, & Bowman, 2015). Along these lines, privacy protection belief refers to a situation when consumers believe and expect that online vendors will keep their personal private information from hacking or unauthorized using (Li et al., 2011). The perceived privacy empowerment provided by SNSs

vendors can increase users' trust and willingness of disclosure personal private information (Dyke, Midha, & Nemati, 2007). In fact, “privacy risk belief has a signiﬁcant and negative impact on online consumers' behavioral intention to disclose their personal private information” (Li et al., 2011, p. 438). Users’ attitudes of privacy inﬂuence their disclosure behaviors on Facebook (Stutzman, Capra, & Thompson, 2011). Hence, an individual with a privacy risk belief reduces her/his information disclosure which is the behavior of self-concealment and participates in SNSs through lurking.
Previous studies used ISA to ﬁnd a relationship between users’ attitudes and behavior (Bulgurcu, Cavusoglu, & Benbasat, 2010). In their quest, they omitted the inﬂuence of ISA on CFIP, consumer alienation, and privacy risk belief. Hence, this study ﬁlls up these research gaps to redeem prior shortcomings.
As far as the consequences of privacy risk belief, past research investigated the inﬂuence of users’ behavioral intentions mainly based on privacy calculus theory (Li et al., 2011). Stutzman et al. (2011) later conﬁrmed the effect of privacy attitudes on disclosure. Users reduce their willingness to disclose information when they perceive risks. Self-concealment is just one of the two sides of disclosures and has rarely been examined in the context of the negative behavior caused by privacy risk belief including lurking and the concealment behavior of personal information. Lurking was mainly used to explain the behavior and the inﬂuence extent on CFIP generated from computer anxiety (Osatuyi, 2015) without treating lurking as the consequence. This study also ﬁlls up these two research gaps and investigates the effects of privacy risk belief on lurking and self-concealment.
Besides, previous studies only conﬁrmed that negative privacy attitudes reduce the willingness to disclose information by an individual (Stutzman et al., 2011) instead of examining the transformation process regarding the effects of users' privacy attitudes on the reduction of disclosing personal information. Selfconcealment is on the opposite side of self-disclosure. In other words, privacy risk belief increases an individual's willingness of self-concealment. Therefore, this study tackles this research gap and treats lurking as the mediation effect between privacy risk belief and self-concealment. In addition, prior research only conﬁrmed the effects of privacy risk belief on negative behavior instead of investigating the detailed consequences of privacy risk belief. Thus, this study incorporates perceived privacy empowerment as the moderation effect to examine its inﬂuence on the relationships between privacy risk belief and lurking/selfconcealment to ﬁll up the research gap.
A key factor of the success and sustainability of SNS is user's attitude and behavior in the long-run. SNSs providers make continuous and repeated efforts to attract more users and supply effective information related to Internet advertisement and marketing in SNSs' communities (Kang & Shin, 2008). However, there are questions regarding the user's attitude and behavior about personal private information after the occurrence of privacy risk in SNSs. These questions are: i) Does ISA inﬂuence privacy risk belief through concern for information privacy or consumer alienation? ii) Does privacy risk belief inﬂuence lurking and self-concealment after the effects of concern for information privacy and consumer alienation? iii) Is perceived privacy empowerment a moderator between privacy risk belief and lurking/self-concealment?
There are three research objectives in this study. The ﬁrst research objective is to investigate the effects of ISA on concern for information privacy and consumer alienation as well as the effects of ISA, concern for information privacy, and consumer alienation on privacy risk belief of SNSs users. The second research objective is to examine the relationships among privacy risk belief, lurking, and self-concealment to understand the self-protection procedure of

lurking and self-concealment adopted by SNSs users with the inﬂuence of privacy risk belief. This research framework proposes two mediation effects to further investigate the relationships among constructs. Smith, Milberg, and Burke (1996) indicated that people show concern for information privacy about threats coming from the collection and unauthorized secondary use of personal private information by others. Individuals generate ISA and concern for information privacy to subjectively assess potential loss and expected risk (Li et al., 2011). Therefore, this study treats concern for information privacy as the mediator between ISA and privacy risk belief and tests such a mediation effect. In addition, SNSs users believe that they cannot change the status quo of SNSs and feel powerlessness and normlessness (Schwaig et al., 2013). The business ethics factor includes the collection of personal information without the consent of the customer in SNS environments. This study treats consumer alienation as the mediator between ISA and privacy risk belief and tests this mediation effect. The third research objective is to assume perceived privacy empowerment as the moderator between privacy risk belief and lurking/selfconcealment and tests these moderators according to the privacy calculus theory which indicates an opposite relationship between privacy protection belief and privacy risk belief.
There are indeed studies around SNSs issues. However, there is no research on SNSs users' behaviors regarding privacy calculus framework from the perspectives of lurking and self-concealment. There are four contributions of this study related to the usage and behavior of SNSs users. The ﬁrst contribution is about the effects of ISA on concern for information privacy, consumer alienation, and privacy risk belief. This study investigates the relationships among ISA, concern for information privacy, consumer alienation, and privacy risk belief to understand SNSs users behaviors. The second contribution is about the effects of privacy risk belief on lurking and self-concealment. Previous scholars have only discussed the negative effects of concern for information privacy and privacy risk belief on users' behavioral intentions which subsequently let them to discontinue their usage. This study investigates the ﬁnal behavior of privacy risk belief such as lurking and self-concealment. The third contribution is about the mediation effects of concern for information privacy, consumer alienation, and lurking. It has been envisioned that SNSs users' behavior can be inﬂuenced. SNSs users assess whether continue to use or take a self-protection behavior when they perceive risks from SNSs. The fourth and ﬁfth contributions are related to the moderator of perceived privacy empowerment. Perceived privacy empowerment can raise users’ trust toward SNSs and increase their willingness to disclose personal information (Dyke et al., 2007). This study investigates the moderators of perceived privacy empowerment between privacy risk belief and lurking/self-concealment from the perspective of perceived privacy empowerment of users.
2. Literature review and hypotheses development
2.1. Theoretical foundation
Privacy protection belief refers to a situation when consumers believe and expect that online vendors will keep their personal private information from hacking or unauthorized using (Li et al., 2011). The perceived privacy empowerment provided by SNSs vendors can increase users' trust and willingness of disclosure personal private information (Dyke et al., 2007). In fact, “privacy risk belief has a signiﬁcant and negative impact on online consumers' behavioral intention to disclose their personal private information” (Li et al., 2011, p. 438). Users’ attitudes of privacy inﬂuence their disclosure behaviors on Facebook (Stutzman et al., 2011). Hence, an individual with a privacy risk belief reduces her/

his information disclosure which is the typical behavior of selfconcealment and participates in SNSs through lurking.
It is worth to reﬂect on the issue of improving information security environment to raise users' continuity in SNSs. Large SNSs such as Facebook and Google often raise the security level of their users and improve their privacy protection as a response to their pressure for information security and account protection. SNSs provide data protection measures to satisfy users’ requirements for information privacy (Berendt, Günther, & Spiekermann, 2005; Milne & Culnan, 2004). In spite of providing SNSs users the function of information protection and reminding them about the importance of information security issues to reduce their information security risks embedded in personal data, photos, or videos, SNSs users lack of an understanding about information security policy and the available set-up functions for information privacy (Berendt et al., 2005; Milne & Culnan, 2004). SNSs users generate concern for information privacy and worry about the disclosure of personal private information because they do not know how to set up protection procedures under the lack of ISA. In addition, SNSs users gradually feel powerless, generate alien psychology, and unconsciously reveal or ignore to protect their personal private information. The ﬁrst motivation of this study is to investigate the relationships among ISA, concern for information privacy, and consumer alienation.
SNSs users express more concern about privacy issues related to personal private information abuse and accounts being hacked when they provide additional personal private information in SNSs (Whelan, 2005). Privacy risk belief inﬂuences the disclosure of personal information (Culnan & Bies, 2003; Dinev & Hart, 2006). SNSs users feel the concern for information privacy and the existence of risk beliefs when releasing personal information (Malhotra et al., 2004). The investigation of the effects of ISA, concern for information privacy and consumer alienation on privacy risk belief is the second motivation of this study.
Privacy risk belief negatively affects consumers' behavioral intention to disclose personal information (Li et al., 2011) to the extent of getting concerned about their privacy being disclosed in SNSs (Stutzman et al., 2011). These studies have only investigated the inﬂuence on users' self-disclosure behaviors after the generation of privacy risk belief. There has been no research on people's behavior of lurking and self-concealment. The third motivation of this study is then to explore the effects of privacy risk belief on lurking and self-concealment.
Privacy protection belief and privacy risk belief are two opposite constructs in the privacy calculus theory. Users generate privacy protection belief and reduce privacy risk belief when they subjectively think that SNSs providers have the capability of protecting their personal private information. Users modify their lurking behaviors depending on the perception of how their personal private information is protected. They are not easily inﬂuenced by others about their personal private information and generate privacy risk belief if SNSs vendors can provide secure mechanisms to assure their privacy. The investigation of the moderator for perceived privacy empowerment between privacy risk belief and lurking/selfconcealment is the fourth motivation of this study.
2.2. Information security awareness
ISA refers to the degree of protection awareness users toward web vendors who set up security and protection mechanisms to assure users generating trusting beliefs and intentions (McKnight, Choudhury, & Kacmar, 2002). ISA is an important element of an effective information security management program (Cavusoglu, Cavusoglu, Son, & Benbasat, 2009). An individual or an institution faces extreme threat when there is a loss of effectiveness in their

protection systems. The increase of an individual's ISA can effectively reduce the problem of system abuse or shortage of information security cognition. SNSs vendors provide various measures to ameliorate their users' information security performances (Albrechtsen & Hovden, 2010).
Bulgurcu et al. (2010, p. 532) deﬁned ISA as “an employee's general knowledge about information security and her/his cognizance of the information security policies (ISP) of his organization”. General information security awareness (GISA) and information security policy awareness (ISPA) are two dimensions of ISA. The deﬁnitions of general information security awareness and ISP awareness are “an employee's overall knowledge and understanding of potential issues related to information security and their ramiﬁcations” and “an employee's knowledge and understanding of the requirements prescribed in the organization's ISP and the aims of those requirements” (Bulgurcu et al., 2010, p. 532). von Solms (1999) considered that SNSs providers must set up an information security policy and formally announce it to their users. SNSs users must thoroughly read SNSs' relevant regulations to know their information security policies and become aware of their information privacy when they open an account in SNSs.
2.3. Concern for information privacy
Information privacy refers to the ability of individuals to control their personal information (Culnan & Bies, 2003; Stone, Gueutal, Gardner, & McClure, 1983). Concern for information privacy is a subjective opinion of justice within the scope of information privacy for an individual (Campbell, 1999). Privacy and Internet security are the major concerns for disclosing personal information in SNSs (Bryer & Chen, 2010).
Smith et al. (1996) proposed 15 measurement items for four operationalized dimensions of concern for information privacy. These dimensions are collection, unauthorized secondary use, improper access, and errors. Collection refers to the action of gathering personal data whether it is legal or not. An individual's main concern is whether SNSs providers collect and store her/his data appropriately or not. Unauthorized secondary use refers to individuals' concerns whether SNSs vendors gather their data for one purpose and inappropriately use such data for another purpose without their authorization. Improper access refers to other unauthorized people use an individual's personal information for different purposes and view this particular data without her/his authorization. Errors refer to an individual's concern whether SNSs providers can adequately protect her/his data without any accident or intentional errors (Slyke, Shim, Johnson, & Jiang, 2006).
The concept of people's privacy and concern comes from privacy social norms which “take into account how other people or friends inﬂuence the SNS user into keeping their information privacy” (Zlatolas, Welzer, Hericko, & Ho€lbl, 2015, p. 162). Altman (1977) proposed the concept of inﬂuence of culture on personal privacy. In the past, public opinion and norms were important ingredients to the concepts of privacy and value. Facebook users should use a variety of settings for privacy concern (Christoﬁdes, Muise, & Desmarais, 2009).
2.4. Consumer alienation
Consumer alienation involves a sense of segregation from the norms and values of the marketplace in terms of a business ethics factor. Alienated consumers feel powerlessness and normlessness regarding their information privacy (Schwaig et al., 2013). The marketplace is understood as all the institutions that offer goods or services and conduct related actions or performances (Johnson,

146

J. Ortiz et al. / Computers in Human Behavior 80 (2018) 143e157

1996). Nowadays, there is consensus that alienated consumers do not intend to accept or identify themselves with current market institutions, practices, and outputs. Instead, they must get involved in these institutions to appropriately play the role as consumers (Mady, 2011; Pruden, Shuptrine, & Longman, 1974; Shuptrine, Pruden, & Longman, 1977). However, these consumers do not take their expected roles when they enter the marketplace to engage in a transaction. Consequently, they become more socially isolated (Mady, 2011). Seeman (1959) systematically identiﬁed ﬁve alternative meanings of alienation: powerlessness, meaninglessness, normlessness, isolation, and self-estrangement. Powerlessness refers to an individual's consciousness that her/his action cannot achieve the consequence which s/he pursues (Mady, 2011; Seeman, 1959). Powerlessness is a state in which consumers are unable to affect a business action to meet their requirements (Johnson, 1996). An alienated consumer considers that s/he cannot control any perspective encountered in the marketplace (Lambert, 1981). Meaninglessness refers to a state in which an individual is not sure about what s/he should believe in. The lack of a clear set of standards in the behavior of an individual buyer meets the phenomenon of meaninglessness where consumers feel that the transactions or products are not worth the effort (Mady, 2011; Pruden et al., 1974). On the other hand, normlessness is that social norms regulating behavior do not provide effective rules any more for individuals to follow (Mady, 2011) and marketers will conduct unethical, unjust, and undesirable ways to attain their selﬁsh purposes (Johnson, 1996). Finally, isolation is a sense of estrangement or isolation from the marketplace which includes institutions, practices, and outputs of the market system (Johnson, 1996; Mady, 2011; Middleton, 1963; Seeman, 1959). Selfestrangement, as social isolation, refers to an individual who regards her/himself as an alien and more easily relates to others rather than to her/him (Mady, 2011) as well as the lack of ability to recognize her/his behavior and role as a consumer (Allison, 1978). This individual's consumption pattern is to satisfy others' expectations instead of herself/himself (Mady, 2011).

‘silent majorities’ in an electronic forum, one who posts occasionally or not at all but is known to read the group's postings regularly” (Sun, Rau, & Ma, 2014, p. 111). Lurkers are individuals who read other members' messages but never post any content (Neelen & Fetter, 2010) or post messages once in a while (Golder & Donath, 2004). A lurker is the one who does not publish or post a message for a certain period of time and does not make any contribution to the community (Nonnecke & Preece, 2001) as well as posts less than three messages from the beginning (Ganley, Moser, & Groenewegen, 2012).
Chen (2004) proposed three quantitative criteria for a lurker. First, a lurker logs weekly into the community to observe the activities in SNSs throughout a six week span. Second, her/his weekly frequency of postings is less than the online group average. Third, the ratio of her/his frequency of postings over the login frequency count is higher than the online group average. Regrettably, not many studies have investigated these criteria because the online community culture, topic, and size may exert effects on lurking behaviors. Posters send messages to online communities from time to time and make contributions to these communities. In contrast, lurkers never send messages to online communities, remain silent all the time, and read more postings than they create, edit, or write (Sun et al., 2014). Prior studies not only regarded a lurker as a freerider but also portrayed a negative attitude toward her/him (Kollock & Smith, 1996; Morris & Ogan, 1996; Rheingold, 1993; Sun et al., 2014; Wellman & Gulia, 1999).
The reasons a lurker does not join a conversation in SNSs are highlighted by Nonnecke, Andrews, and Preece (2006). The majority of lurkers think that it is enough for them to just browse and read (Nonnecke et al., 2006). Lurkers think that they can satisfy their needs by just browsing messages. However, once lurkers feel distractions and do not satisfy the online information content, they leave the SNSs immediately (Mo & Coulson, 2010; Nonnecke et al., 2006). SNSs users are considered lurking and do not disclose their opinions and thoughts when they feel anxiety. It is then their best choices to join SNSs (Osatuyi, 2015).

2.5. Privacy risk belief

2.7. Self-concealment

Recently, people have paid more attention on Internet privacy issues. Companies such as Amazon, eBay, Facebook, and Google have severely suffered due to privacy-related problems. Consumers decide to disclose their personal information based on cost-beneﬁt analysis established around the privacy calculus framework. Privacy risk belief is the potentially negative consequence within the privacy calculus framework. Consumers subjectively think about privacy risk belief as the expected loss to a speciﬁc online vendor by disclosing their personal information (Li et al., 2011). They are most concerned about the illegal abuse of personal private information. Owing to the perpetual property of SNSs, any issued information or uploaded document can be duplicated or edited by others. It is possible that personal private information gets stolen and utilized by others no matter how much time has passed. Overall, 88.2 percent of all respondents who are over 16 years old worry about their personal private information on Internet purchases (Cole, 2004). Therefore, people gradually pay more attention on the issue of privacy.
2.6. Lurking
The participation and contribution of SNSs members on community activities vary as time goes by. They adopt multiple roles when participating in a community during a different time period (Lave & Wenger, 1991; Wenger, 1998). A lurker refers to a SNS member who observes instead of actively participating in a SNS (Bishop, 2007; Dennen, 2008; Osatuyi, 2015). A lurker is ‘‘one of the

In psychology, an individual chooses to hide personal negative or depressed information, emotion, behavior, thought, or incident when s/he faces others. Self-concealment refers to the tendency of keeping certain distance away from others related to personal private information for individuals. These behaviors include providing negative comments in concealment, getting away from others, and being concerned about self-exposure (Larson & Chastain, 1990). Self-concealment indicates the internal maladaptive regulation process in various clinical phenomena (Masuda & Latzman, 2012). Self-concealment is not part of the fundamental personal characteristics of individuals. However, an individual chooses to hide personal private information when s/he faces a special situation. For instance, an individual worries about the risk of disseminating personal private information and provides false data when s/he ﬁlls it out (Cepeda-Benito & Short, 1998).
Moscovitch (2009) considered that an individual generates social community anxiety when s/he is afraid of being supervised and assessed by others in public for her/his behavior due to the disclosure of her/his weakness. The defects of self-attribute are anxiety, appearance, personality, and social skills. An individual generates response and behavior of bad adaptation such as concealing her/his personal private information and actual feeling because of disturbances in the communication of SNSs.
SNSs users generate negative emotions such as anxiety, avoidance, and frustration because of the service provided by the SNSs or during the process of establishing a relationship with others

J. Ortiz et al. / Computers in Human Behavior 80 (2018) 143e157

147

(Bevan, Pfyl, & Barclay, 2012). An individual's behavior and decision are inﬂuenced by her/his emotion. Beaudry and Pinsonneault (2010) indicated that an individual modiﬁes her/his behavior based on emotion and the situation to inﬂuence the usage for both smartphone users and SNSs users.
Stutzman et al. (2011) pointed out that individuals’ attitudes toward privacy inﬂuence their disclosure practices in the SNSs. Selfdisclosure refers to an individual who disseminates her/his personal information such as experiences, feelings, and personal thoughts for the purpose of sharing personal information in the interaction with others (Derlega, Metts, Petronio, & Margulis, 1993; Greene, Derlega, & Mathews, 2006; Wheeless & Grotz, 1976; Wheeless, 1978). On the contrary, self-concealment refers to an individual who conceals her/his personal information on purpose and does not disclose personal information or provide inaccurate information during an interpersonal interaction. People generate self-concealment to lower their self-disclosure behaviors if concern for information privacy is higher no matter if they conduct commercial transactions or simply share information and communicate emotions in SNSs. An individual with self-concealment avoids to struggle with the anxiety of self-disclosure (Larson & Chastain, 1990). Therefore, SNSs users choose self-concealment and reduce the amount and frequency of self-disclosure to minimize risk. Thus, they can avoid the trouble associated with self-disclosure when they generate privacy risk belief and subsequently generate concern for self-disclosure.
2.8. Perceived privacy empowerment
Perceived privacy empowerment refers to as how users perceive the degree of empowerment of controlling personal private information from the privacy mechanisms provided by SNSs vendors (Slyke et al., 2006). In other words, it is the degree of user's’ perception about the protection of personal information privacy. Web merchants indicated that SNSs providers can increase consumers' trust if they reduce users' concerns for information privacy (Slyke et al., 2006).
2.9. Hypotheses development
Fishbein (2008) identiﬁed variables that may directly or indirectly affect the consequence of any action. Ajzen and Albarracin (2007) argued that an individual's background such as experience, demographics, knowledge, and disposition can inﬂuence her/ his intention and behavior on the effects of appropriate antecedents. Therefore, this study infers that users' behaviors related to ISA facilitate information security further diminish the information privacy problem. SNSs users express stronger privacy concerns if they have higher privacy awareness (Boyd & Hargittai, 2010). For example, Zlatolas et al. (2015) indicated that students have become more aware of the privacy issues on Facebook based on the results of Boyd and Hargittai's study (2010). An organization offers security awareness to its employees as the most crucial element to convince them to modify their behaviors into compliance (Siponen, 2000). Lee and Larsen (2009) pointed out that executives of small- and medium-sized businesses generate additional concerns for information privacy when they have higher ISA to reduce the effect of threat appraisal on intention to adopt anti-malware software for their organizations based on the protection motivation theory. This study proposes the following hypothesis.
H1. SNSs members' information security awareness has a signiﬁcant and positive effect on concern for information privacy.
Consumers generate alienation because they feel powerless and normless about the privacy protection practice provided by web

vendors when they pay attention to personal private information and are aware of an information privacy problem (Schwaig et al., 2013). Alienated consumers embrace less consumption activities because they have no control over the scenario they face in the marketplace (Mady, 2011). Consumers generate alienation with normlessness to marketplace when there is ISA and feel that SNSs providers are not able to improve their information privacy problem. This study proposes the following hypothesis.
H2. SNSs members' information security awareness has a significant and positive effect on consumer alienation.
An individual's attitude toward conducting a certain action is related to her/his belief about behavior-related outcomes (Ajzen, 1991; Fishbein & Ajzen, 1975; Fishbein, 2007). It is common for SNSs users to reduce their perception level of privacy protection belief when they ﬁrst browse or are unfamiliar with an online vendor with strong concern for information privacy or awareness of the existence of information security problem in disclosing their personal information (Li et al., 2011; Smith et al., 1996). This study proposes the following hypothesis.
H3. : SNSs members' information security awareness has a signiﬁcant and positive effect on privacy risk belief.
Concern for information privacy is deﬁned as an individual's subjective views of fairness and the concern about information privacy (Li et al., 2011; Malhotra et al., 2004). It reﬂects the individual's perception of information privacy belief for risk in the website environment (Li, 2014). SNSs user's privacy risk belief increases when s/he perceives unfriendly intention or behavior from others and anticipates the threat of personal privacy in SNSs environment. General privacy concern has a signiﬁcant and positive effect on privacy risk belief (Buchanan, Paine, Joinson, & Reips, 2007; Dinev & Hart, 2006; Smith et al., 1996; Stewart & Segars, 2002). Owing to the conﬂict of internal emotion of privacy protection belief and privacy risk belief, a SNS user increases her/his perception of privacy risk belief when s/he has strong concern for information privacy (Li et al., 2011). This study proposes the following hypothesis.
H4. SNSs members' concern for information privacy has a significant and positive effect on privacy risk belief.
A SNS user gets alienated when s/he feels powerless and does not trust the transaction taking place at the SNSs market. S/he generates greater negative attitudes when s/he has a higher alienation and expresses higher concerns for her/his information privacy and usage experience (Schwaig et al., 2013). Consumer alienation has a positive effect on concern for information privacy which subsequently has a negative effect on attitude toward the information practice (Schwaig et al., 2013). In addition, Li et al. (2011) indicated that general privacy concern for disclosing personal private information has a signiﬁcant and positive effect on privacy risk belief. Therefore, this study infers that consumer alienation has a signiﬁcant and positive effect on privacy risk belief and proposes the following hypothesis.
H5. SNSs members' alienation has a signiﬁcant and positive effect on privacy risk belief.
Privacy risk belief is the cost factor that governs user's information disclosure in the privacy calculus framework (Li et al., 2011). Risk beliefs have a negative effect on the intention to reveal personal private information in an online marketplace (Mesch, 2012; Zimmer, Arsal, Al-Marzouq, & Grover, 2010). Disclosure of personal private information through face-to-face interactions do not leave any record and others do not have the opportunity to keep

track the information shared which does not occur in an online environment. Therefore, people with a strong privacy risk belief tend to disclose their personal private information through face-toface interactions (Chen & Marcus, 2012). A SNSs user reduces her/ his information disclosure and becomes a lurker when s/he generates privacy risk belief. This study proposes the following hypothesis.
H6. SNSs members' privacy risk belief has a signiﬁcant and positive effect on lurking.
SNSs users ignore the negative emotion of concern for information privacy and continue to use SNSs due to the inﬂuence of colleagues and others when they perceive the invasion of personal information privacy and subsequently generate privacy risk belief. Risk belief negatively affects SNSs users’ intentions to disclose personal information (Mesch, 2012; Zimmer et al., 2010). SNSs users refrain from disclosing their personal information and become lurkers themselves when they generate privacy risk beliefs because of the inﬂuence of privacy. In fact, privacy risk belief has a negative effect on self-disclosure. Research on e-commerce conﬁrmed that privacy risk belief has a signiﬁcant and negative effect on disclosing personal private information to unfamiliar enterprises in e-commerce (Li et al., 2011).
Lurking and self-concealment are types of self-protection practices for SNSs users. They refuse to disclose personal private information to protect personal information security. A lurker chooses to conceal personal information and does not divulge actual personal private information based on self-protection principle. This study proposes the following hypotheses.
H7. SNSs members' privacy risk belief has a signiﬁcant and positive effect on self-concealment.
H8. SNSs members' lurking has a signiﬁcant and positive effect on self-concealment.
Privacy and network security are main barriers for SNSs users to disclose personal information (Bryer & Chen, 2010). SNSs providers can raise consumers’ behavioral intention of disclosing their personal information if they increase their privacy protection beliefs based on the privacy calculus framework (Li et al., 2011). Consumers will continue to use SNSs if SNSs providers guarantee a safely perceived privacy empowerment under the inﬂuence of negative emotions such as concern for information privacy and privacy risk belief. This study proposes the following hypotheses.
H9. Perceived privacy empowerment has a signiﬁcant moderation effect between privacy risk belief and lurking.
H10. Perceived privacy empowerment has a signiﬁcant moderation effect between privacy risk belief and self-concealment.
3. Methodology
3.1. Questionnaire design, pre-test, and pilot study
This study uses prior constructs and validates them through a pre-test and three pilot tests. It also revises measurement items' wordings of constructs based on the feedback of Taiwanese SNSs users. This study invites two professors of management information systems and three active SNSs users to review the measurement items' wordings. Twelve independent rounds (3 people for each) of the pre-test with SNSs users are conducted. The measurement items’ wordings were revised during the face-to-face interaction with SNSs users to make sure they embraced the SNSs context in Taiwan. Subsequently, this study conducts three pilot

tests with different SNSs users to ensure the ﬁnal questionnaire addresses the convergent validity, reliability analysis, and discriminant validity of the measurement items and constructs.
3.2. Sample and data collection
There are three parts in this framework. The ﬁrst part includes information security awareness, concern for information privacy, consumer alienation, and privacy risk belief. The second part is the perspective of behavior which is the consequence of the effect of information privacy issue of SNSs users and includes lurking and self-concealment. The third part is the perceived privacy empowerment which acts as a moderator. Fig. 1 shows the research framework.
This study investigates users’ attitudes and behaviors regarding the occurrence of privacy risk in SNSs. Hence, the target respondents are SNSs users. They respond to an online survey through mySurvey in http://www.mysurvey.tw in Taiwan. This study offers ﬁfty 300 New Taiwan Dollars (NTD) and one hundred 100 NTD for a convenient store to raise their response rate. This online survey was conducted from December 9, 2016 to February 10, 2017. There were 489 valid samples out of 683 collected samples and the completion rate was 71.60%. Table 1 shows the respondent demographics. The demographic split is male (54.14%) vs. female (45.86%), 20e24 years old (73.46%), followed by under 19 years old (17.20%), with junior college/college degree (80.89%), followed by senior high school degree (11.04%), year experience of using Facebook for more than 4 years (51.38%), followed by 3e4 years (18.68%), daily hours on Facebook between 4 and 6 h (44.16%), followed by under 3 h (31.85%).
3.3. Measures
Information security awareness, concern for information privacy, consumer alienation, privacy risk belief, lurking, selfconcealment, and perceived privacy empowerment are the seven constructs for this framework. This study applies a seven-point Likert scale anchored between 1 (“strongly disagree”) and 7 (“strongly agree”) to measure scale items for information security awareness, concern for information privacy, consumer alienation, and privacy risk belief. ISA is deﬁned as a user's overall understanding of information security, the regulation of information policy, and the relevant knowledge related to potential problems and six measurement items are adapted from Bulgurcu et al. (2010). The deﬁnition of concern for information privacy is the degree of user's concern for information security and personal privacy and fourteen measurement items are adapted from Schwaig et al. (2013). Consumer alienation is deﬁned as the degree of user's powerless regarding the SNSs' behaviors and mechanisms within the marketplace and twelve measurement items are adapted from Schwaig et al. (2013). The deﬁnition of privacy risk belief is the anticipation of the potential loss when a user provides her/his personal information and four measurement items are adapted from Li et al. (2011). The measurement items for lurking, selfconcealment, and perceived privacy empowerment are measured by a ﬁve-point Likert scale anchored between 1 (“strongly disagree”) and 5 (“strongly agree”). Lurking is deﬁned as the degree by which a user only browses contents without disclosing personal private information in SNSs and four measurement items are adapted from Osatuyi (2015). The deﬁnition of self-concealment is a user's psychological tendency by concealing her/his inside negative or uneasy message toward others and ten measurement items are adapted from Larson and Chastain (1990). Perceived privacy empowerment is deﬁned as a user's perception of a privacy protection mechanism provided by SNSs and four measurement

4. Analysis and results
4.1. Common method variance
The problems of common method variance (CMV) are dealt through the adoption of prevention and post-detection procedures. As far as the prevention procedure, this study uses an anonymous

questionnaire, random order for measurement items, various scales, and concealed constructs names to diminish SNSs users' concerns when they ﬁll up the questionnaire (Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee, & Podsakoff, 2003). This study adopts Harman's one-factor test to detect the CMV according to previous ﬁndings (Harman, 1967) and applies the exploratory factor analysis (EFA) suggested by Podsakoff and Organ (1986) for a post-detection procedure. Table 2 indicates that nine factors can be extracted from the EFA and the ﬁrst factor can explain 24.215% of the variance which is lower than 50%.

This study also conducts the one factor analysis of conﬁrmatory factor analysis (CFA) and incorporates all ﬁfty measurement items except 4 reversed measurement items of seven constructs in one factor. Table 3 illustrate that not all of measurement items’ factor loadings are larger than 0.50 (signiﬁcant) and the model ﬁt of one
factor (Chi-quare ¼ 9330.535, DF ¼ 1175, c2/DF ¼ 7.941, GFI ¼ 0.414,
AGFI ¼ 0.364, IFI ¼ 0.364, CFI ¼ 0.361, RMSR ¼ 0.137) is worse than the model ﬁt of the proposed model (Chi-quare ¼ 1881.926,
DF ¼ 975, c2/DF ¼ 1.930, GFI ¼ 0.846, AGFI ¼ 0.829, IFI ¼ 0.925,
CFI ¼ 0.925, RMSR ¼ 0.062). Therefore, this study does not present a problem regarding CMV.
4.2. Measurement model
This study applies composite reliability (CR) and average variance extracted (AVE) to measure the convergent validity of measurement items and constructs through AMOS software with the maximum likelihood estimation (Hair Jr., Black, Babin, & Anderson, 2010). Table 4 shows that the CR values are all larger than 0.7 which validates the internal consistency for the measurement items of each construct (Hulland, 1999). All the AVE values are larger than 0.5 except lurking (0.440) and self-concealment (0.423). Nunnally (1978) proposed that a construct is reliable if the factor loadings of all measurement items are larger than 0.4 as well as the CR is larger than 0.6. Therefore, each construct has an appropriate convergent validity. Table 5 illustrates that all the correlations between any two constructs are larger than the square root of AVE of each construct to demonstrate the discriminant validity of this study (Fornell & Larcker, 1981).
This study uses squared multiple correlations (SMC) and Cron-
bach a (Bagozzi & Yi, 1988) to measure the internal consistency for
reliability. It shows the reliability of each construct if all SMC values are larger than 0.2 (Bentler & Wu, 1993; Jo€reskog & So€rbom, 1993)
and the Cronbach a values are larger than 0.7 (Nunnally, 1978). The
SMC values for each measurement are between 0.335 and 0.897
and the Cronbach a values fall between 0.752 and 0.901 which
corroborates the internal consistency for each construct.
4.3. Structural model
The overall model ﬁt (c2 ¼ 1881.926, df ¼ 975, p < 0.001, c2/
df ¼ 1.930, GFI ¼ 0.846, TLI ¼ 0.920, CFI ¼ 0.925 and RMSEA ¼ 0.044) is appropriate. Table 6 illustrates the results of the proposed hypotheses while Fig. 2 shows their path diagram. The proposed hypotheses are all supported. The results indicate that ISA has a signiﬁcant and positive effect on concern for information
privacy (g11 ¼ 0.324, p < 0.001), consumer alienation (g21 ¼ 0.362, p < 0.001), and privacy risk belief (g31 ¼ 0.229, p < 0.001), sup-
porting H1, H2, and H3. In addition, concern for information privacy and consumer alienation have signiﬁcant and positive effects on
privacy risk belief (b31 ¼ 0.523, p < 0.001; b32 ¼ 0.156, p < 0.001),

4.4. Moderation effect
This study validates the moderation effect of perceived privacy empowerment between privacy risk belief and lurking as well as between privacy risk belief and self-concealment through a multigroup causal analysis and separates samples into two subgroups based on the mean (3.86) of their perceived privacy empowerment. The numbers of samples for the high and low group of perceived privacy empowerment are 236 and 235, respectively. The set up for the high and low groups of perceived privacy empowerment are the constrained and the unconstrained models for the original samples without segregating them and later testing the modera-
tion effect through the differences of chi-square values (△c2) be-
tween the constrained model and the unconstrained model as well as the p-value. Table 7 shows the result of the moderation effect for

perceived privacy empowerment between privacy risk belief and
lurking as well as the differences of chi-square values (△c2) be-
tween the constrained and the unconstrained model is 4.198 (p < 0.001) which conﬁrms a signiﬁcant difference between the high and low group of perceived privacy empowerment.
Table 8 illustrates the result of the moderation effect for perceived privacy empowerment between privacy risk belief and self-concealment as well as the differences in chi-square values
(△c2) between the constrained and the unconstrained model is
8.568 (p < 0.001) which also underscores a signiﬁcant difference between the high and low group of perceived privacy empowerment.
As far as the relationship between privacy risk belief and lurking, the standardized path coefﬁcient for the high perceived privacy empowerment group is 0.275 (p < 0.001) whereas the standardized

path coefﬁcient for the low perceived privacy empowerment group is 0.309 (p < 0.001). Though the standardized path coefﬁcients between privacy risk belief and lurking are signiﬁcant and positive for both groups, the value for the high perceived privacy empowerment group is smaller than the value for the low perceived privacy empowerment group. It demonstrates that privacy risk belief causes lower lurking for a SNSs user if s/he has a higher perceived privacy empowerment. Therefore, H9 is supported.
For the relationship between privacy risk belief and selfconcealment, the standardized path coefﬁcient for the high perceived privacy empowerment group is 0.431 (p < 0.001) whereas the standardized path coefﬁcient for the low perceived privacy empowerment group is 0.413 (p < 0.001). Though the standardized path coefﬁcients between privacy risk belief and selfconcealment are signiﬁcant and positive for both groups, the value of high perceived privacy empowerment group is larger than the value of low perceived privacy empowerment group. It indicates that privacy risk belief causes higher self-concealment for a SNSs user if s/he has a higher perceived privacy empowerment. Therefore, H10 is supported.
4.5. Mediation effect
This study measures mediation effects based on the results of a structural model. There are three mediation effects in this framework. (1) The mediation effect of concern for information privacy between ISA and privacy risk belief. (2) The mediation effect of consumer alienation between ISA and privacy risk belief. (3) The mediation effect of lurking between privacy risk belief and selfconcealment. Table 9 shows that the values of the Sobel test are all larger than 1.96 (Sobel, 1982) and that all 95% conﬁdence intervals of the Bootstrapping analysis for the 5000 simulations do not include 0 (Efron & Tibshirani, 1993) which implies that all three mediation effects are signiﬁcant. Table 10 illustrates that all three mediation effects are partial mediators.

5. Conclusions
5.1. Key ﬁndings and contributions
SNSs users are more concerned about their personal information security when they have a stronger ISA. As the concept of privacy has evolved, SNSs users now pay more attention to their privacy issues. Most SNSs users are concerned about their personal private information and worry about their loss regarding privacy. Thus, they demand privacy protection (Boyle & Johnson, 2010).
SNSs users are aware of the problems of information privacy and there is nothing they can do about it. This subsequently generates alienation as they do not expect that SNSs would provide them with a secure environment when they have higher ISA (Mady, 2011; Schwaig et al., 2013). SNSs users produce a more negative attitude toward information privacy when they have higher alienation (Schwaig et al., 2013). The empirical results support the ﬁndings of Lee and Larsen (2009) in terms of the signiﬁcant and positive effect of ISA on privacy risk belief. SNSs users protect themselves through threat appraisal and generate a strong risk belief regarding privacy when they have high sense of ISA.
Prior research underscored the reasons that prevent lurkers of having an active participation in the discussion of SNSs. Lurkers think that their needs consist of just browsing others’ discussions in SNSs (Nonnecke et al., 2006). In addition, bad experiences in the usage of SNSs affect users becoming lurkers and reducing their selfdisclosure (Osatuyi, 2015). Trust is the main factor of triggering behavior (Nonaka, Toyama, & Konno, 2000). Only members who trust each other can trigger their sharing for implicit information. A SNS user generates privacy risk belief and does not trust SNSs that induce her/him to become a lurker and not sharing personal information and self-concealment for personal information.
The protection of users' personal private information from SNSs providers affects users' degree of trust to SNSs. The operational complexity of SNSs and the website layout inﬂuence users' perceive risk (Metzger, 2004). The coefﬁcient between privacy risk belief and lurking for a highly perceived privacy empowerment group is lower than of the low perceived privacy empowerment one. The effect of privacy risk belief on lurking is lower when SNSs users have a higher perceived privacy empowerment. Privacy empowerment provided by SNSs can reduce the possibility of a user with privacy risk belief becoming a lurker. This result supports previous ﬁndings which illustrate that SNSs increase consumers' trust if they can reduce users’ concerns for information privacy (Slyke et al., 2006). Fodor and Brem (2015) also corroborated that trust has a signiﬁcant and positive effect on usage intention. Users will have usage intention if SNSs providers can increase their trust.
SNSs users are concerned about their information privacy when they have ISA. SNSs users gradually generate alienation when they realize that they cannot change the status quo of the market. SNSs users are afraid of leaking personal private information when they

generate privacy risk belief. Their reactions to SNSs are to conceal their personal information and to not disclose their personal information. A SNSs user becomes a lurker and maintains a lurking behavior during the process of concealing personal information after s/he generates privacy risk belief.
5.2. Academic implications
Prior research failed to consider the assortment of aspects related to the antecedents of privacy risk belief. They only adopted general privacy concern, privacy perceived, and privacy awareness as the antecedents of privacy risk belief. This study proposes that concern for information privacy and the sub-dimensions of ISA such as general information security awareness (GISA) and information security policy awareness (ISPA) as well as consumer alienation which have seldom been investigated are antecedents of privacy risk belief. The new perspective of this research ﬁlls up the research gap from previous studies.
Privacy concern and alienation lead to lurking and concealment. A SNSs user gradually becomes a lurker and chooses to reduce selfdisclosure from the point of protecting her/his personal private information when s/he faces the impact of any information privacy issue. Past research of lurking was in the ﬁelds of psychology or behavioral science. It barely adopted lurking as a behavioral variable even in the ﬁeld of information technology. This study uses self-disclosure as a theoretical foundation. SNSs users reduce selfdisclosure when they are affected by a negative emotion (Stutzman et al., 2011). Prior research conﬁrmed that a user's concern for privacy has a negative effect on her/his attitude and usage intention. This study adopts lurking and self-concealment as the consequences of the effect of negative emotion for SNSs users. A SNS user will not completely quit using SNS but s/he would become a lurker and adopt self-concealment. There are three processes of social inﬂuence theory: compliance, identiﬁcation, and internalization (Kelman, 1958). Zhou and Li (2014) referred to these three processes of social inﬂuence as subject norms, group norms, and social identity. Continuous intention and usage intention were widely discussed with social inﬂuence in past studies of SNSs users' behaviors (Wang, Meister, & Gray, 2013). This study infers about the reason why SNSs users choose lurking and self-concealment instead of not quitting using SNS is the effect of social inﬂuence. This kind of behavior is also called the herd behavior. Sun (2013) pointed out that herd behavior is quite common in the context of information technology usage behavior. A SNS user will give up her/ his thought and follows others' actions when herd behavior occurs (Bikhchandani & Sharma, 2000).
SNSs users generate perceived privacy empowerment and think that SNSs facilitate the protection of personal privacy if SNSs vendors effectively provide privacy empowerment. Hence, they reduce lurking by lowering privacy risk belief. Both concern for information privacy and consumer alienation is important factors in the

process of generating privacy risk belief for SNSs users with ISA. SNSs users treat privacy from a cost-beneﬁt perspective based on self-protection and believing that personal privacy is risky in a SNSs environment due to the concern for information privacy and powerless of environment. SNSs users with a privacy risk belief go through the lurking process instead of concealing personal private information in SNSs. They do not stop using SNSs immediately but continue to use SNSs in a lurking way when they perceive the threat of privacy. In addition, these lurkers do not disclose their real personal information. Instead, they adopt self-concealment for the purpose of self-protection.
5.3. Practical implications
The fact that SNSs users need to ﬁll out their personal information in order to open an account in SNSs causes problems of information security and has a huge impact on users' intentions to keep using SNSs. SNSs users reduced their SNSs activities in order to ameliorate the leak of personal private information. They restrict themselves to just browse the SNSs contents without expressing their thoughts and providing personal private information. The incidents of information security are serious because of the claim of sharing and publicity by SNSs. It is crucial for SNSs providers to make users' continuous participation in activities in SNSs. Nowadays; many enterprises utilize SNSs as the media for promoting products through the Internet. They increase the exposure of products through fan page advertisements or activities. SNSs activities are the best channels for delivering products' information. Businesses can quickly reach the dissemination effect by sharing information with their customers. They obtain revenues by increasing customers' utilizations or raising users' willingness of disseminating information in SNSs. This study provides guidelines for SNSs vendors to improve users’ intentions of using SNSs and disclose their personal private information in SNSs.
Currently, the sense of ISA is common among SNSs users. SNSs providers must increase their safety levels of an information security system to prevent hackers intruding their systems and stealing users' personal private information. In addition, SNSs providers cannot release users' personal information to a third party under any circumstance without the authorization or permission from the SNSs users. SNSs providers must establish friendly and secure environments to mitigate users' concerns for information security as well as provide users’ perceived privacy empowerment to alleviate their lurking and self-concealment. SNSs providers must improve privacy protection procedures for their users to increase their intentions of sharing information.
5.4. Limitations and future research directions
It is difﬁcult to collect data from websites outside Taiwan. Future research may include conducting surveys from other countries to

increase the samples size and provide appropriate incentives for SNSs users to expand the scope of research. A longitudinal study is also desired to further extend SNSs users’ long-term behaviors. Future research can integrate other relevant constructs such as brand, word-of-mouth (WOM), personality, and website responsiveness or adopt appropriate theoretical models to improve the predictability of the research framework.
