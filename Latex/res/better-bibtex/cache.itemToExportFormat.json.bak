In this work, we aim to find out if text contains private content by using our novel learning based approach `privacy detective' that combines topic modeling, named entity recognition, privacy ontology, sentiment analysis, and text normalization to represent privacy features. Privacy detective investigates a broader range of privacy concerns compared to previous approaches that focus on keyword searching or profile related properties. We collected 500,000 tweets from 100,000 Twitter users along with other information such as tweet linkages and follower relationships. We reach 95.45% accuracy in a two-class task classifying Twitter users who do not reveal much private information and Twitter users who share sensitive information. We score timelines according to three privacy levels after having Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) workers annotate collected tweets according to privacy categories. Supervised machine learning classification results on these annotations reach 69.63% accuracy on a three-class task. Inter-annotator agreement on timeline privacy scores between various AMT workers and our classifiers fall under the same positive agreement level. Additionally, we show that a user's privacy level is correlated with her friends' privacy scores and also with the privacy scores of people mentioned in her text but not with the number of her followers. As such, privacy in social networks appear to be socially constructed, which can have great implications for privacy enhancing technologies and educational interventions.","title":"Privacy Detective: Detecting Private Information and Collective Privacy Behavior in a Large Social Network","proceedingsTitle":"Proceedings of the 13th Workshop on Privacy in the Electronic Society","shortTitle":"Privacy Detective","creators":[{"firstName":"Aylin","lastName":"Caliskan Islam","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jonathan","lastName":"Walsh","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Rachel","lastName":"Greenstadt","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["RU8RKIZJ"],"relations":{"dc:relation":["http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/AKPX9Y47"],"dc:replaces":["http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/JWHMAHZB"]},"dateAdded":"2018-02-17T00:49:40Z","dateModified":"2018-06-08T23:37:56Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/KCRCQD4D","attachments":[{"key":"DVMCP3S2","version":295,"itemType":"attachment","url":"http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/2670000/2665958/p35-islam.pdf?ip=132.227.79.222&id=2665958&acc=ACTIVE%20SERVICE&key=7EBF6E77E86B478F%2EA72B4D473219EA0C%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35&__acm__=1525277769_e0ff20c37b51d9e04b0c485c42f1f873","accessDate":"2018-05-02T16:11:44Z","title":"Caliskan Islam et al. - 2014 - Privacy Detective Detecting Private Information a.pdf","parentItem":"KCRCQD4D","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Caliskan Islam et al. - 2014 - Privacy Detective Detecting Private Information a.pdf","note":"<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"title\"><strong>Contents</strong></p><ul xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" style=\"list-style-type: none;

Unfortunately, this wealth of social information is fragmented across many different proprietary applications. Combined, it could provide a more accurate representation of the social world, and it could enable a whole new set of socially-aware applications. We introduce Prometheus, a peer-to-peer service that collects and manages social information from multiple sources and implements a set of social inference functions while enforcing user-defined access control policies. Prometheus is socially-aware: it allows users to select peers that manage their social information based on social trust and exploits naturally-formed social groups for improved performance. We tested our Prometheus prototype on PlanetLab and built a mobile social application to test the performance of its social inference functions under realtime constraints. We showed that the social-based mapping of users onto peers improves the service response time and high service availability is achieved with low overhead.","title":"Prometheus: User-controlled P2P Social Data Management for Socially-aware Applications","proceedingsTitle":"Proceedings of the ACM/IFIP/USENIX 11th International Conference on Middleware","shortTitle":"Prometheus","creators":[{"firstName":"Nicolas","lastName":"Kourtellis","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Joshua","lastName":"Finnis","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Anderson","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jeremy","lastName":"Blackburn","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Cristian","lastName":"Borcea","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Adriana","lastName":"Iamnitchi","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["VJ5ZGL9W"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-03-06T23:17:42Z","dateModified":"2018-06-07T16:37:04Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/CBGXYNBB","attachments":[{"key":"7C4FJNYW","version":120,"itemType":"attachment","url":"http://dl.acm.org.accesdistant.upmc.fr/ft_gateway.cfm?id=2023733&type=pdf","accessDate":"2018-03-06T23:17:55Z","title":"Kourtellis et al. -

The steep rise in the amount of unsolicited emails, i.e. spam, in the past decade, however, has permanently disrupted this tranquility of largely steady email volume and turned mail server performance into an increasingly important issue. In this paper, we point out that modern mail servers were not originally designed with email spam in mind, and as such, as the \"common case” workload for mail servers has shifted from legitimate emails to spam emails, we argue it is time to revisit mail server architecture design in following the system design principle of optimizing the common case. In particular, we show how to optimize the performance of three major components of modern mail servers, the concurrency architecture, the disk I/O, and DNSBL lookups, by exploiting the new \"common case\" workload. An evaluation of our prototype implementation of the enhanced postfix architecture shows that the optimizations significantly reduce the CPU, disk, and network resource consumptions, and improves the throughput of the mail server by 18% under a university departmental mail server workload and by 40% under a spam sinkhole workload.","title":"The Case for Spam-Aware High Performance Mail Server Architecture","proceedingsTitle":"2009 29th IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems","creators":[{"firstName":"A.","lastName":"Pathak","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"S.

The initial exposition of the background examines the basics of e-mail spam filtering, the evolving nature of spam, spammers playing cat-and-mouse with e-mail service providers (ESPs), and the Machine Learning front in fighting spam. We conclude by measuring the impact of Machine Learning-based filters and explore the promising offshoots of latest developments.","title":"Machine Learning for E-mail Spam Filtering: Review,Techniques and Trends","shortTitle":"Machine Learning for E-mail Spam Filtering","creators":[{"firstName":"Alexy","lastName":"Bhowmick","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Shyamanta M.","lastName":"Hazarika","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["5NDLJ3M4"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-03-07T14:11:10Z","dateModified":"2018-06-19T13:49:11Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/JG4P3UE7","attachments":[{"key":"GI4WDTKL","version":321,"itemType":"attachment","url":"http://www.arxiv.org/pdf/1606.01042.pdf","accessDate":"2018-03-07T14:11:49Z","title":"Bhowmick_Hazarika_2016_Machine Learning for E-mail Spam Filtering.pdf","parentItem":"JG4P3UE7","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Bhowmick_Hazarika_2016_Machine Learning for E-mail Spam Filtering.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-03-07T14:11:49Z","dateModified":"2018-03-07T14:11:50Z"}],"notes":[{"key":"XS3GMMSV","version":16,"itemType":"note","parentItem":"JG4P3UE7","note":"<p>E-mail and Spam Filters</p>\n<p>Structure of an E-mail</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>2.

Many web spam demotion algorithms have been developed to combat spam via the use of the web link structure, from which the goodness or badness score of each web page is evaluated. Those scores are then used to identify spam pages or punish their rankings in search engine results. However, most of the published spam demotion algorithms differ from their base models by only very limited improvements and still suffer from some common score manipulation methods. The lack of a general framework for this field makes the task of designing high-performance spam demotion algorithms very inefficient. In this paper, we propose a unified score propagation model for web spam demotion algorithms by abstracting the score propagation process of relevant models with a forward score propagation function and a backward score propagation function, each of which can further be expressed as three sub-functions: a splitting function, an accepting function and a combination function. On the basis of the proposed model, we develop two new web spam demotion algorithms named Supervised Forward and Backward score Ranking (SFBR) and Unsupervised Forward and Backward score Ranking (UFBR). Our experiments, conducted on three large-scale public datasets, show that (1) SFBR is very robust and apparently outperforms other algorithms and (2) UFBR can obtain results comparable to some well-known supervised algorithms in the spam demotion task even if the UFBR is unsupervised.","title":"A unified score propagation model for web spam demotion algorithm","creators":[{"firstName":"Xu","lastName":"Zhuang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Zhu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Chin-Chen","lastName":"Chang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Peng","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Faisal","lastName":"Khurshid","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["VJ5ZGL9W"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-03-07T17:26:04Z","dateModified":"2018-06-19T13:49:11Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/3QGAUCUS","attachments":[{"key":"6YBDFJRH","version":117,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://link-springer-com.accesdistant.upmc.fr/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10791-017-9307-9.pdf","accessDate":"2018-03-07T17:26:17Z","title":"Zhuang et al_2017_A unified score propagation model for web spam demotion algorithm.pdf","parentItem":"3QGAUCUS","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Zhuang et al_2017_A unified score propagation model for web spam demotion algorithm.pdf","note":"<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"title\"><strong>Contents</strong></p><ul xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" style=\"list-style-type: none;

One of the fundamental difﬁculties is quantifying the amount of information revealed unintentionally. We present PrivAware, a tool to detect and report unintended information loss in online social networks. Our goal is to provide a rudimentary framework to identify privacy risk and provide solutions to reduce information loss. The ﬁrst instance of the software is focused on information loss attributed to social circles. In subsequent releases we intend to incorporate additional capabilities to capture ancillary threat models. From our initial results, we quantify the privacy risk attributed to friend relationships in Facebook. We show that for each user in our study a majority of their personal attributes can be derived from social contacts. Moreover, we present results denoting the number of friends contributing to a correctly inferred attribute. We also provide similar results for different demographics of users. The intent of PrivAware is to not only report information loss but to recommend user actions to mitigate privacy risk. The actions provide users with the steps necessary to improve their overall privacy measurement. One obvious, but not ideal, solution is to remove risky friends. Another approach is to group risky friends and apply access controls to the group to limit visibility. In summary, our goal is to provide a unique tool to quantify information loss and provide features to reduce privacy risk.","title":"Measuring Privacy Risk in Online Social Networks","creators":[{"firstName":"Justin","lastName":"Becker","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Chen","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["UASSXJNU"],"relations":{"dc:relation":["http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/AKPX9Y47"]},"dateAdded":"2018-03-13T20:52:04Z","dateModified":"2018-06-08T23:37:53Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/EK2I2FWV","attachments":[{"key":"GESQM5C9","version":319,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Becker - 2009 - Measuring privacy risk in online social networks.pdf","parentItem":"EK2I2FWV","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Becker - 2009 - Measuring privacy risk in online social networks.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-01-19T09:56:10Z","dateModified":"2018-03-13T21:28:25Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":1210,"key":"EK2I2FWV"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578763594,"version":0},"$loki":243},{"itemID":14,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":319,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Becker - 2009 - Measuring privacy risk in online social networks.pdf","parentItem":"EK2I2FWV","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Becker - 2009 - Measuring privacy risk in online social networks.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-01-19T09:56:10Z","dateModified":"2018-03-13T21:28:25Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/GESQM5C9","itemID":14,"key":"GESQM5C9"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578763594,"version":0},"$loki":244},{"itemID":3094,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":355,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Mujtaba et al. - 2017 - Email Classification Research Trends Review and O.pdf","parentItem":"2ERJCMLX","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Mujtaba et al. - 2017 - Email Classification Research Trends Review and O.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-11-26T17:00:03Z","dateModified":"2018-11-29T11:10:22Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/JDIBCZWU","itemID":3094,"key":"JDIBCZWU"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578763610,"version":0},"$loki":247},{"itemID":1265,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":172,"itemType":"conferencePaper","pages":"131-138","date":"June 2013","extra":"00040","DOI":"10.1109/ICWS.2013.27","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","conferenceName":"2013 IEEE 20th International Conference on Web Services","abstractNote":"Service selection is a key issue in the Future Internet, where applications are built by composing services and content offered by different service providers. Most existing service selection schemas only focus on QoS properties of services such as throughput, latency and response time, or on their trust and reputation level. By contrast, the risk of privacy breaches arising from the selection of component services whose privacy policy is not compliant with customers' privacy preferences is largely ignored. In this paper, we propose a novel privacy-preserving Web service composition and selection approach which (i) makes it possible to verify the compliance between users' privacy requirements and providers' privacy policies and (ii) ranks the composite Web services with respect to the privacy level they offer. We demonstrate our approach using a travel agency Web service as an example of service composition.","title":"Privacy-Aware Web Service Composition and Ranking","proceedingsTitle":"2013 IEEE 20th

recent increase in reported incidents of surveillance and security breaches compromising users’ privacy call into question the current model, in which third-parties collect and control massive amounts of personal data. Bitcoin has demonstrated in the ﬁnancial space that trusted, auditable computing is possible using a decentralized network of peers accompanied by a public ledger. In this paper, we describe a decentralized personal data management system that ensures users own and control their data. We implement a protocol that turns a blockchain into an automated access-control manager that does not require trust in a third party. Unlike Bitcoin, transactions in our system are not strictly ﬁnancial – they are used to carry instructions, such as storing, querying and sharing data. Finally, we discuss possible future extensions to blockchains that could harness them into a well-rounded solution for trusted computing problems in society.","title":"Decentralizing Privacy: Using Blockchain to Protect Personal Data","shortTitle":"Decentralizing Privacy","creators":[{"firstName":"Guy","lastName":"Zyskind","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Oz","lastName":"Nathan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Alex 'Sandy'","lastName":"Pentland","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["ED2DJ6VG"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-03-28T09:39:09Z","dateModified":"2018-06-08T23:38:26Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/VRLJPRDM","attachments":[{"key":"6J8KA2H9","version":222,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://enigma.co/ZNP15.pdf","accessDate":"2018-03-28T09:39:06Z","title":"Zyskind et al. - 2015 - Decentralizing Privacy Using Blockchain to Protec.pdf","parentItem":"VRLJPRDM","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Zyskind et al. - 2015 - Decentralizing Privacy Using Blockchain to Protec.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-03-28T09:39:06Z","dateModified":"2018-03-28T09:39:11Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":1778,"key":"VRLJPRDM"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578763786,"version":0},"$loki":269},{"itemID":1777,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":222,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://enigma.co/ZNP15.pdf","accessDate":"2018-03-28T09:39:06Z","title":"Zyskind et al. - 2015 - Decentralizing Privacy Using Blockchain to Protec.pdf","parentItem":"VRLJPRDM","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Zyskind et al. - 2015 - Decentralizing Privacy Using Blockchain to Protec.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-03-28T09:39:06Z","dateModified":"2018-03-28T09:39:11Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/6J8KA2H9","itemID":1777,"key":"6J8KA2H9"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578763786,"version":0},"$loki":270},{"itemID":1781,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":172,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://upcommons.upc.edu/bitstream/handle/2117/110446/TSP1de1.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y","accessDate":"2018-03-28T10:13:51Z","title":"TSP1de1.pdf","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"TSP1de1.pdf","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-03-28T10:13:51Z","dateModified":"2018-03-28T10:13:51Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/58X354GK","itemID":1781,"key":"58X354GK"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578763804,"version":0},"$loki":271},{"itemID":1806,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":172,"itemType":"journalArticle","pages":"50","date":"2009","extra":"00168","libraryCatalog":"Zotero","language":"en","abstractNote":"Users and network administrators need ways to ﬁlter email messages based primarily on the reputation of the sender. Unfortunately, conventional mechanisms for sender reputation—notably, IP blacklists—are cumbersome to maintain and evadable. This paper investigates ways to infer the reputation of an email sender based solely on network-level features, without looking at the contents of a message. First, we study ﬁrst-order properties of network-level features that may help distinguish spammers from legitimate senders. We examine features that can be ascertained without ever looking at a packet’s contents, such as the distance in IP space to other email senders or the geographic distance between sender and receiver. We derive features that are lightweight, since they do not require seeing a large amount of email from a single IP address and can be gleaned without looking at an email’s contents—many such features are apparent from even a single packet. Second, we incorporate these features into a classiﬁcation algorithm and evaluate the classiﬁer’s ability to automatically classify email senders as spammers or legitimate senders. We build an automated reputation engine, SNARE, based on these features using labeled data from a deployed commercial spam-ﬁltering system. We demonstrate that SNARE can achieve comparable accuracy to existing static IP blacklists: about a 70% detection rate for less than a 0.3% false positive rate. Third, we show how SNARE can be integrated into existing blacklists, essentially as a ﬁrst-pass ﬁlter.","title":"Detecting Spammers with SNARE: Spatio-temporal Network-level Automatic Reputation Engine","creators":[{"firstName":"Shuang","lastName":"Hao","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Nadeem Ahmed","lastName":"Syed","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Nick","lastName":"Feamster","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Alexander G","lastName":"Gray","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Sven","lastName":"Krasser","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["D2M4DBVZ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-13T07:59:54Z","dateModified":"2018-06-08T23:38:03Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/WE7FASVW","attachments":[{"key":"HWXQMZ2U","version":338,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/sec09/tech/full_papers/sec09_network.pdf","accessDate":"2018-04-13T07:59:54Z","title":"Hao et al. - Detecting Spammers with SNARE Spatio-temporal Net.pdf","parentItem":"WE7FASVW","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Hao et al. - Detecting Spammers with SNARE Spatio-temporal Net.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-13T07:59:54Z","dateModified":"2018-04-13T07:59:55Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":1806,"key":"WE7FASVW"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578763806,"version":0},"$loki":272},{"itemID":1805,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":338,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/sec09/tech/full_papers/sec09_network.pdf","accessDate":"2018-04-13T07:59:54Z","title":"Hao et al. - Detecting Spammers with SNARE Spatio-temporal Net.pdf","parentItem":"WE7FASVW","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Hao et al. - Detecting Spammers with SNARE Spatio-temporal Net.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-13T07:59:54Z","dateModified":"2018-04-13T07:59:55Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/HWXQMZ2U","itemID":1805,"key":"HWXQMZ2U"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578763806,"version":0},"$loki":273},{"itemID":1809,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":172,"itemType":"bookSection","url":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-642-35076-4_2","volume":"344","place":"Berlin, Heidelberg","publisher":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","pages":"9-18","ISBN":"978-3-642-35075-7 978-3-642-35076-4","date":"2012","extra":"00000","accessDate":"2018-04-13T11:03:03Z","libraryCatalog":"CrossRef","language":"en","abstractNote":"Spam and anti-spam techniques are part of email since its birth.

Most of the current anti-spamming systems focus on incoming spam but these messages still travel the internet world and waste bandwidth, storage and processing resources. This research proposes a collaborative outgoing anti-spam technique to reduce the spread of spam on the internet. The technique targets outgoing emails and its use would free the internet from 260 billion spam a day. During real-time experiment, it blocked 99.95% of the total spam generated with 99.57% elimination at sender side.","title":"COAT: Collaborative Outgoing Anti-spam Technique","bookTitle":"Advances in Information Technology","shortTitle":"COAT","creators":[{"firstName":"Borworn","lastName":"Papasratorn","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Nipon","lastName":"Charoenkitkarn","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Kittichai","lastName":"Lavangnananda","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Wichian","lastName":"Chutimaskul","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Vajirasak","lastName":"Vanijja","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Adnan","lastName":"Ahmad","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Brian","lastName":"Whitworth","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["64KQ9FFC"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-13T11:03:03Z","dateModified":"2018-05-31T17:28:00Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/NDJDH67J","attachments":[{"key":"C476TI88","version":277,"itemType":"attachment","url":"http://brianwhitworth.com/2012IAIT-COAT.pdf","accessDate":"2018-04-13T11:03:01Z","title":"Ahmad and Whitworth - 2012 - COAT Collaborative Outgoing Anti-spam Technique.pdf","parentItem":"NDJDH67J","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Ahmad and Whitworth - 2012 - COAT Collaborative Outgoing Anti-spam Technique.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-13T11:03:01Z","dateModified":"2018-04-13T11:03:03Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":1809,"key":"NDJDH67J"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578763822,"version":0},"$loki":274},{"itemID":1808,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":277,"itemType":"attachment","url":"http://brianwhitworth.com/2012IAIT-COAT.pdf","accessDate":"2018-04-13T11:03:01Z","title":"Ahmad and Whitworth - 2012 - COAT Collaborative Outgoing Anti-spam Technique.pdf","parentItem":"NDJDH67J","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Ahmad and Whitworth - 2012 - COAT Collaborative Outgoing Anti-spam Technique.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-13T11:03:01Z","dateModified":"2018-04-13T11:03:03Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/C476TI88","itemID":1808,"key":"C476TI88"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578763824,"version":0},"$loki":275},{"itemID":1858,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":7,"itemType":"conferencePaper","pages":"82-87","date":"October 2011","extra":"00016","DOI":"10.1109/CASON.2011.6085923","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","conferenceName":"2011 International Conference on Computational Aspects of Social Networks (CASoN)","abstractNote":"Recommender systems have become increasingly important in e-commerce as they can guide customers with finding personalized services and products. A variant of recommender systems that generates recommendations from a set of trusted people is recently getting more attention in social networks. However, people are concerned about their privacy as the information revealed in recommender systems, particularly in social networks, can be misused easily. A way to eliminate the privacy risks is to make the privacy-sensitive data inaccessible by means of encryption. While the private data is inaccessible to any outsiders and the server, the same functionality of the system can be achieved by processing the encrypted data. Unfortunately, the efficiency of processing encrypted data constitutes a big challenge. In this paper, we present a privacy-enhanced recommender system in a social trust network, which is designed to be highly efficient. The cryptographic protocol for generating recommendations is based on homomorphic encryption and secure multi-party computation techniques. The additional overhead with regard to computation and communication is minimized by packing data. The experimental results show that our proposal is promising to be deployed in real world.","title":"Generating private recommendations in a social trust network","proceedingsTitle":"2011 International Conference on Computational Aspects of Social Networks (CASoN)","creators":[{"firstName":"Z.","lastName":"Erkin","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"T.","lastName":"Veugen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"R.

The advent of HTTPS was supposed to make proﬁling harder for anyone beyond the communicating end-points. In this paper we examine to what extent the above is true. We ﬁrst show that by knowing the domain that a user visits, either through the Server Name Indication of the TLS protocol or through DNS, an eavesdropper can already derive basic proﬁling information, especially for domains whose content is homogeneous. For domains carrying a variety of categories that depend on the particular page that a user visits, e.g., news portals, e-commerce sites, etc., the basic proﬁling technique fails. Still, accurate proﬁling remains possible through transport layer ﬁngerprinting that uses network trafﬁc signatures to infer the exact page that a user is browsing, even under HTTPS. We demonstrate that transport ﬁngerprinting remains robust and scalable despite hurdles such as caching, dynamic content for different device types etc.Overall our results indicate that although HTTPS makes proﬁling more difﬁcult, it does not eradicate it by any means.","title":"User Profiling in the Time of HTTPS","creators":[{"firstName":"Roberto","lastName":"Gonzalez","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Claudio","lastName":"Soriente","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Nikolaos","lastName":"Laoutaris","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["5NDLJ3M4"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-23T12:54:10Z","dateModified":"2018-05-23T12:54:10Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/79JHV4XC","attachments":[{"key":"KDWZMBUE","version":363,"itemType":"attachment","url":"http://laoutaris.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/imc2016-paper69.pdf","accessDate":"2018-05-23T12:54:08Z","title":"Gonzalez et al. - 2016 - User Profiling in the Time of HTTPS.pdf","parentItem":"79JHV4XC","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Gonzalez et al. - 2016 - User Profiling in the Time of HTTPS.pdf","note":"<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"title\"><strong>Contents</strong></p><ul xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" style=\"list-style-type: none;

In this research, we aim to address some critical issues related to privacy protection: Would the highest privacy settings guarantee a secure protection? Given the open nature of social networking sites, is it possible to manage one's privacy protection? With the diversity of one's social media friends, how can one figure out an effective approach to balance between vulnerability and privacy? We present a novel way to define a vulnerable friend from an individual user's perspective is dependent on whether or not the user's friends' privacy settings protect the friend and the individual's network of friends (which includes the user). As a single vulnerable friend in a user's social network might place all friends at risk, we resort to experiments and observe how much security an individual user can improve by unfriending a vulnerable friend. We also show how privacy weakens if newly accepted friends are unguarded or unprotected. This work provides a large-scale evaluation of new security and privacy indexes using a Facebook dataset. We present and discuss a new perspective for reasoning about social networking security. When a user accepts a new friend, the user should ensure that the new friend is not an increased security risk with the potential of negatively impacting the entire friend network. Additionally, by leveraging the indexes proposed and employing new strategies for unfriending vulnerable friends, it is possible to further improve security and privacy without changing the social networking site's existing architecture.","title":"Exploiting Vulnerability to Secure User Privacy on a Social Networking Site","proceedingsTitle":"Proceedings of the 17th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","creators":[{"firstName":"Pritam","lastName":"Gundecha","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Geoffrey","lastName":"Barbier","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Huan","lastName":"Liu","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"privacy","type":1},{"tag":"social network","type":1},{"tag":"vulnerability","type":1}],"collections":["RU8RKIZJ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-24T14:19:06Z","dateModified":"2018-05-24T14:19:07Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/CQ2RJFF3","attachments":[{"key":"7MGY7XVZ","version":123,"itemType":"attachment","url":"http://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=2020489&type=pdf","accessDate":"2018-05-24T14:19:07Z","title":"Gundecha et al_2011_Exploiting Vulnerability to Secure User Privacy on a Social Networking Site.pdf","parentItem":"CQ2RJFF3","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Gundecha et al_2011_Exploiting Vulnerability to Secure User Privacy on a Social Networking Site.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-24T14:19:07Z","dateModified":"2018-05-24T14:19:08Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":1886,"key":"CQ2RJFF3"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578763950,"version":0},"$loki":290},{"itemID":1887,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":123,"itemType":"attachment","url":"http://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=2020489&type=pdf","accessDate":"2018-05-24T14:19:07Z","title":"Gundecha et al_2011_Exploiting Vulnerability to Secure User Privacy on a Social Networking Site.pdf","parentItem":"CQ2RJFF3","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Gundecha et al_2011_Exploiting Vulnerability to Secure User Privacy on a Social Networking Site.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-24T14:19:07Z","dateModified":"2018-05-24T14:19:08Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/7MGY7XVZ","itemID":1887,"key":"7MGY7XVZ"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578763950,"version":0},"$loki":291},{"itemID":1890,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":172,"itemType":"conferencePaper","pages":"1-7","date":"December 2016","extra":"00002","DOI":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2016.7842168","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","conferenceName":"2016 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)","abstractNote":"In online social networks (OSNs), individual users have a strong desire to expand their social networks through OSN activities and try to maximize the benefits from the social relationships, called social capital. However, with a large-scale social network, their privacy rights have been significantly intruded by adversarial users that perform social attacks including false / illegal private information dissemination or the use of fake identities. In this work, we study how individual users can expand their social networks by making trustworthy friends while not leaking their private information out to unauthorized parties or social attackers. We adopt the concepts of trust and reputation in order to preserve users' privacy while enhancing their social capital in OSNs. Given a social network topology from the Facebook, we model an individual user's interactions with other users based on feeding (e.g., posting information) and feedback behaviors (e.g., providing likes or comments). Our results show that there exists a tradeoff between social capital and privacy preservation. In addition, we show there exists a balance point of social capital and privacy thresholds that maximizes correct information diffusion while minimizing illegal private information leakout, given users' risk appetite for preserving privacy.","title":"Privacy and Social Capital in Online Social Networks","proceedingsTitle":"2016 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)","creators":[{"firstName":"J.

In this paper we discuss and present an overview of the terms of trust and reputation from the literature.","title":"An overview of the interpretations of trust and reputation","proceedingsTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (EFTA 2007)","creators":[{"firstName":"F.

However due to data sparsity of the input ratings matrix, the step of finding similar users often fails. We propose to replace this step with the use of a trust metric, an algorithm able to propagate trust over the trust network and to estimate a trust weight that can be used in place of the similarity weight. An empirical evaluation on Epinions.com dataset shows that Recommender Systems that make use of trust information are the most effective in term of accuracy while preserving a good coverage. This is especially evident on users who provided few ratings.","title":"Trust-aware Recommender Systems","proceedingsTitle":"Proceedings of the 2007 ACM Conference on Recommender Systems","creators":[{"firstName":"Paolo","lastName":"Massa","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Paolo","lastName":"Avesani","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["VJ5ZGL9W"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-25T08:23:44Z","dateModified":"2018-06-19T13:49:11Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/M2PQIBRI","attachments":[{"key":"9YINJ4PY","version":247,"itemType":"attachment","url":"http://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=1297235&type=pdf","accessDate":"2018-05-25T08:23:45Z","title":"Massa_Avesani_2007_Trust-aware Recommender Systems.pdf","parentItem":"M2PQIBRI","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Massa_Avesani_2007_Trust-aware Recommender Systems.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-25T08:23:45Z","dateModified":"2018-05-25T08:23:45Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":1905,"key":"M2PQIBRI"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578764040,"version":0},"$loki":298},{"itemID":1906,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":247,"itemType":"attachment","url":"http://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=1297235&type=pdf","accessDate":"2018-05-25T08:23:45Z","title":"Massa_Avesani_2007_Trust-aware Recommender Systems.pdf","parentItem":"M2PQIBRI","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Massa_Avesani_2007_Trust-aware Recommender Systems.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-25T08:23:45Z","dateModified":"2018-05-25T08:23:45Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/9YINJ4PY","itemID":1906,"key":"9YINJ4PY"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578764040,"version":0},"$loki":299},{"itemID":1908,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":8,"itemType":"conferencePaper","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4545620/","publisher":"IEEE","pages":"233-238","date":"06/2008","extra":"00046","DOI":"10.1109/ICIW.2008.41","accessDate":"2018-05-25T08:56:07Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","language":"en","abstractNote":"By the immense growth of the Web-Based Social Networks (WBSNs), the role of trust in connecting people together through WBSNs is getting more important than ever. In other words, since the probability of malicious behavior in WBSNs is increasing, it is necessary to evaluate the reliability of a person before trying to communicate with. Hence, it is desirable to ﬁnd out how much a person should trust another one in a network. The approach to answer this question is usually called trust inference. In this paper, we propose a new trust inference algorithm (Called RN-Trust) based on the resistive networks concept. The algorithm, in addition to being simple, resolves some problems of previously proposed approaches. The analysis of the algorithm demonstrates that RN-Trust calculates the trust values more accurately than previous approaches.","title":"Trust Inference in Web-Based Social Networks Using Resistive Networks","creators":[{"firstName":"Mohsen","lastName":"Taherian","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Morteza","lastName":"Amini","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Rasool","lastName":"Jalili","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["64KQ9FFC"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-25T08:56:07Z","dateModified":"2018-05-25T08:56:07Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/LQN42QTF","attachments":[{"key":"E73WV7MN","version":299,"itemType":"attachment","url":"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.723.4567&rep=rep1&type=pdf","accessDate":"2018-05-25T08:56:05Z","title":"Taherian et al. - 2008 - Trust Inference in Web-Based Social Networks Using.pdf","parentItem":"LQN42QTF","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Taherian et al. - 2008 - Trust Inference in Web-Based Social Networks Using.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-25T08:56:05Z","dateModified":"2018-05-25T08:56:07Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":1908,"key":"LQN42QTF"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578764054,"version":0},"$loki":300},{"itemID":1907,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":299,"itemType":"attachment","url":"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.723.4567&rep=rep1&type=pdf","accessDate":"2018-05-25T08:56:05Z","title":"Taherian et al. - 2008 - Trust Inference in Web-Based Social Networks Using.pdf","parentItem":"LQN42QTF","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Taherian et al. - 2008 - Trust Inference in Web-Based Social Networks Using.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-25T08:56:05Z","dateModified":"2018-05-25T08:56:07Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/E73WV7MN","itemID":1907,"key":"E73WV7MN"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578764054,"version":0},"$loki":301},{"itemID":1910,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":173,"itemType":"conferencePaper","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6689990/","publisher":"IEEE","pages":"29-36","ISBN":"978-0-7695-5145-6 978-1-4799-2902-3","date":"11/2013","extra":"00011","DOI":"10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.5","accessDate":"2018-05-25T09:18:24Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","language":"en","abstractNote":"Social web permits users to acquire information from anonymous people around the world.

New systems aimed at helping people ﬁnding information of interest and including “social functions” like social networks, tagging, commenting, inserting content, arose. Such systems are the so-called “social recommender systems”. The idea at the base of social recommender systems is that the recommendation of content should follow user’s preferences while social network just represents a group of users joined by some kind of voluntary relation and does not reﬂect any preference. We claim that social network is a very important source of information to proﬁle users. Moving from theories in social psychology which describe inﬂuence dynamics among individuals, we state that joining in a network with other people exposes individuals to social dynamics which can inﬂuence their attitudes, behaviours and preferences.","title":"SoNARS: A Social Networks-Based Algorithm for Social Recommender Systems","bookTitle":"User Modeling, Adaptation, and Personalization","shortTitle":"SoNARS","creators":[{"firstName":"Geert-Jan","lastName":"Houben","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Gord","lastName":"McCalla","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Fabio","lastName":"Pianesi","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Massimo","lastName":"Zancanaro","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Francesca","lastName":"Carmagnola","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Fabiana","lastName":"Vernero","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Pierluigi","lastName":"Grillo","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["64KQ9FFC"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-28T13:33:55Z","dateModified":"2018-06-13T17:47:57Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/GPN6D2I6","attachments":[{"key":"J96562T3","version":352,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-642-02247-0_22.pdf","accessDate":"2018-05-28T13:33:53Z","title":"Carmagnola et al. - 2009 - SoNARS A Social Networks-Based Algorithm for Soci.pdf","parentItem":"GPN6D2I6","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Carmagnola et al. - 2009 - SoNARS A Social Networks-Based Algorithm for Soci.pdf","note":"<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"title\"><strong>Contents</strong></p><ul xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" style=\"list-style-type: none;

We present an algorithm for inferring reputation ratings between individuals and demonstrate through experiments that it is accurate based on current data. We then integrate those scores into a mail application, TrustMail, to show how they may be used in combination with other techniques for sorting and filtering mail.","title":"Reputation Network Analysis for Email Filtering","creators":[{"firstName":"Jennifer","lastName":"Golbeck","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"James","lastName":"Hendler","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["UASSXJNU"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-30T08:41:28Z","dateModified":"2018-06-08T23:38:01Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/4VGFLSSU","attachments":[{"key":"3UBDSFUR","version":205,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e064/cdb09e53eb8243acf01839719bbd52e5ab87.pdf","accessDate":"2018-05-30T08:41:27Z","title":"Golbeck and Hendler - Reputation Network Analysis for Email Filtering.pdf","parentItem":"4VGFLSSU","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Golbeck and Hendler - Reputation Network Analysis for Email Filtering.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-30T08:41:27Z","dateModified":"2018-05-30T08:41:29Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":1952,"key":"4VGFLSSU"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578764162,"version":0},"$loki":312},{"itemID":1951,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":205,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e064/cdb09e53eb8243acf01839719bbd52e5ab87.pdf","accessDate":"2018-05-30T08:41:27Z","title":"Golbeck and Hendler - Reputation Network Analysis for Email Filtering.pdf","parentItem":"4VGFLSSU","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Golbeck and Hendler - Reputation Network Analysis for Email Filtering.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-30T08:41:27Z","dateModified":"2018-05-30T08:41:29Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/3UBDSFUR","itemID":1951,"key":"3UBDSFUR"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578764162,"version":0},"$loki":313},{"itemID":1974,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":173,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4118688/","volume":"18","issue":"4","pages":"460-473","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","ISSN":"1045-9219","date":"4/2007","extra":"00830","DOI":"10.1109/TPDS.2007.1021","accessDate":"2018-06-08T16:39:10Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","language":"en","title":"PowerTrust: A Robust and Scalable Reputation System for Trusted Peer-to-Peer Computing","shortTitle":"PowerTrust","creators":[{"firstName":"Runfang","lastName":"Zhou","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Hwang","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["9P6QWN2J"],"relations":{"dc:replaces":["http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/EMB93RQI"]},"dateAdded":"2018-06-08T16:39:10Z","dateModified":"2018-06-08T16:56:34Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/7PGWRAHD","attachments":[{"key":"B3HWQQSN","version":260,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Zhou and Hwang - 2007 - PowerTrust A Robust and Scalable Reputation Syste.pdf","parentItem":"7PGWRAHD","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Zhou and Hwang - 2007 - PowerTrust A Robust and Scalable Reputation Syste.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-08T16:40:31Z","dateModified":"2018-06-08T16:56:34Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":1974,"key":"7PGWRAHD"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578764186,"version":0},"$loki":316},{"itemID":1975,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":260,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Zhou and Hwang - 2007 - PowerTrust A Robust and Scalable Reputation Syste.pdf","parentItem":"7PGWRAHD","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Zhou and Hwang - 2007 - PowerTrust A Robust and Scalable Reputation Syste.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-08T16:40:31Z","dateModified":"2018-06-08T16:56:34Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/B3HWQQSN","itemID":1975,"key":"B3HWQQSN"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578764188,"version":0},"$loki":317},{"itemID":1986,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":8,"itemType":"journalArticle","pages":"34","date":"2008","extra":"00013","libraryCatalog":"Zotero","language":"en","abstractNote":"To build an efficient reputation system for peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, we need fast mechanisms to aggregate peer evaluations and to disseminate updated scores to a large number of peer nodes. Unfortunately, unstructured P2P networks are short of secure hashing and fast lookup mechanisms as in structured P2P systems like the DHT-based Chord. In light of this shortcoming, we propose a gossiping mechanism to support unstructured P2P communications. This paper reports the design principles and performance results of a GossipTrust system. Gossip-based communications are shown effective to support fast peer scoring and distribution. Gossiping enables light-weight aggregation of local scores and spreading of updated scores to all nodes in O(log2 n) time, where n is the P2P network size.","title":"Gossip-Based Reputation Management for Unstructured Peer-to-Peer Networks","creators":[{"firstName":"Runfang","lastName":"Zhou","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["64KQ9FFC"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-08T16:50:23Z","dateModified":"2018-06-08T17:01:55Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/EVNQSIML","attachments":[{"key":"9UDKZ76E","version":249,"itemType":"attachment","url":"http://gridsec.usc.edu/files/publications/TKDE-submitted-Jan3-2007-Zhou-Hwang-Cai.pdf","accessDate":"2018-06-08T16:50:22Z","title":"Zhou - Gossip-Based Reputation Management for Unstructure.pdf","parentItem":"EVNQSIML","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Zhou - Gossip-Based Reputation Management for Unstructure.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-08T16:50:22Z","dateModified":"2018-06-08T16:50:23Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":1986,"key":"EVNQSIML"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578764244,"version":0},"$loki":324},{"itemID":1985,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":249,"itemType":"attachment","url":"http://gridsec.usc.edu/files/publications/TKDE-submitted-Jan3-2007-Zhou-Hwang-Cai.pdf","accessDate":"2018-06-08T16:50:22Z","title":"Zhou - Gossip-Based Reputation Management for Unstructure.pdf","parentItem":"EVNQSIML","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Zhou - Gossip-Based Reputation Management for Unstructure.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-08T16:50:22Z","dateModified":"2018-06-08T16:50:23Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/9UDKZ76E","itemID":1985,"key":"9UDKZ76E"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578764244,"version":0},"$loki":325},{"itemID":1990,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":173,"itemType":"conferencePaper","url":"http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1772690.1772727","publisher":"ACM Press","pages":"351","ISBN":"978-1-60558-799-8","date":"2010","extra":"00397","DOI":"10.1145/1772690.1772727","accessDate":"2018-06-08T17:09:56Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","language":"en","abstractNote":"Privacy is an enormous problem in online social networking sites.

Current research on privacy protection is centralized around EHR: protecting patient information from being abused by authorized users or being accessed by unauthorized users. Limited eﬀorts have been devoted to studying the attacks performed by manipulating information from external sources, or by joining information from multiple sources. Particularly, we show that (1) healthcare information could be collected by associating and aggregating information across multiple online sources including social networks, public records and search engines. Through attribution, inference and aggregation attacks, user identity and privacy are very vulnerable. (2) People are highly identiﬁable even when the attacker only possess inaccurate information. With real-world case study and experiments, we show that such attacks are valid and threatening. We claim that too much information has been made available electronic and available online that people are very vulnerable without eﬀective privacy protection.","title":"New Privacy Threats in Healthcare Informatics: When Medical Records Join the Web","creators":[{"firstName":"Fengjun","lastName":"Li","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jake Y","lastName":"Chen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Xukai","lastName":"Zou","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Liu","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["UASSXJNU"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-10T12:09:03Z","dateModified":"2018-06-10T12:10:02Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/IZAIQ87X","attachments":[{"key":"44FID8FT","version":83,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Li et al. - New Privacy Threats in Healthcare Informatics Whe.pdf","parentItem":"IZAIQ87X","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Li et al. - New Privacy Threats in Healthcare Informatics Whe.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-10T12:09:01Z","dateModified":"2018-06-10T12:09:03Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":1999,"key":"IZAIQ87X"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578764342,"version":0},"$loki":334},{"itemID":1998,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":83,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Li et al. - New Privacy Threats in Healthcare Informatics Whe.pdf","parentItem":"IZAIQ87X","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Li et al. - New Privacy Threats in Healthcare Informatics Whe.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-10T12:09:01Z","dateModified":"2018-06-10T12:09:03Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/44FID8FT","itemID":1998,"key":"44FID8FT"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578764342,"version":0},"$loki":335},{"itemID":2001,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":173,"itemType":"conferencePaper","url":"http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1772690.1772790","publisher":"ACM Press","pages":"981","ISBN":"978-1-60558-799-8","date":"2010","extra":"00604","DOI":"10.1145/1772690.1772790","accessDate":"2018-06-10T12:20:05Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","language":"en","abstractNote":"Previous work analyzing social networks has mainly focused on binary friendship relations. However, in online social networks the low cost of link formation can lead to networks with heterogeneous relationship strengths (e.g., acquaintances and best friends mixed together). In this case, the binary friendship indicator provides only a coarse representation of relationship information. In this work, we develop an unsupervised model to estimate relationship strength from interaction activity (e.g., communication, tagging) and user similarity. More speciﬁcally, we formulate a link-based latent variable model, along with a coordinate ascent optimization procedure for the inference. We evaluate our approach on real-world data from Facebook and LinkedIn, showing that the estimated link weights result in higher autocorrelation and lead to improved classiﬁcation accuracy.","title":"Modeling relationship strength in online social networks","creators":[{"firstName":"Rongjing","lastName":"Xiang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jennifer","lastName":"Neville","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Monica","lastName":"Rogati","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["UASSXJNU"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-10T12:20:05Z","dateModified":"2018-06-10T12:20:05Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/L6MMH7L3","attachments":[{"key":"47NEQV43","version":85,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/neville/papers/xiang-neville-www2010.pdf","accessDate":"2018-06-10T12:20:02Z","title":"Xiang et al. - 2010 - Modeling relationship strength in online social ne.pdf","parentItem":"L6MMH7L3","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Xiang et al. - 2010 - Modeling relationship strength in online social ne.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-10T12:20:02Z","dateModified":"2018-06-10T12:20:05Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":2001,"key":"L6MMH7L3"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578764360,"version":0},"$loki":336},{"itemID":2000,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":85,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/neville/papers/xiang-neville-www2010.pdf","accessDate":"2018-06-10T12:20:02Z","title":"Xiang et al. - 2010 - Modeling relationship strength in online social ne.pdf","parentItem":"L6MMH7L3","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Xiang et al. - 2010 - Modeling relationship strength in online social ne.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-10T12:20:02Z","dateModified":"2018-06-10T12:20:05Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/47NEQV43","itemID":2000,"key":"47NEQV43"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578764362,"version":0},"$loki":337},{"itemID":2011,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":173,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X17310956","volume":"82","pages":"63-76","publicationTitle":"Future Generation Computer Systems","ISSN":"0167-739X","date":"May 1, 2018","extra":"00000","journalAbbreviation":"Future Generation Computer Systems","DOI":"10.1016/j.future.2017.12.030","accessDate":"2018-06-11T13:12:45Z","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","abstractNote":"Users are not often aware of privacy risks and disclose information in online social networks. They do not consider the audience that will have access to it or the risk that the information continues to spread and may reach an unexpected audience. Moreover, not all users have the same perception of risk. To overcome these issues, we propose a Privacy Risk Score (PRS) that: (1) estimates the reachability of an user’s sharing action based on the distance between the user and the potential audience; (2) is described in levels to adjust to the risk perception of individuals; (3) does not require the explicit interaction of individuals since it considers information flows; and (4) can be approximated by centrality metrics for scenarios where there is no access to data about information flows. In this case, if there is access to the network structure, the results show that global metrics such as closeness have a high degree of correlation with PRS. Otherwise, local and social centrality metrics based on ego-networks provide a suitable approximation to PRS. The results in real social networks confirm that local and social centrality metrics based on degree perform well in estimating the privacy risk of users.","title":"Estimation of privacy risk through centrality metrics","creators":[{"firstName":"J.","lastName":"Alemany","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"E.","lastName":"del Val","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"J.","lastName":"Alberola","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"A.","lastName":"García-Fornes","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Information sharing","type":1},{"tag":"Privacy","type":1},{"tag":"Social networks","type":1}],"collections":["RU8RKIZJ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-11T13:12:45Z","dateModified":"2018-06-11T13:12:46Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/4JW8N6FY","attachments":[{"key":"BZJ38VUD","version":276,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://ac.els-cdn.com/S0167739X17310956/1-s2.0-S0167739X17310956-main.pdf?_tid=8c9eec2f-06b9-48d4-8617-395750d766a4&acdnat=1528722941_696353c98d09c17eb9e14f110625b2a5","accessDate":"2018-06-11T13:12:50Z","title":"Alemany et al_2018_Estimation of privacy risk through centrality metrics.pdf","parentItem":"4JW8N6FY","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Alemany et al_2018_Estimation of privacy risk through centrality metrics.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-11T13:12:50Z","dateModified":"2018-06-11T13:12:51Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":2011,"key":"4JW8N6FY"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578764394,"version":0},"$loki":340},{"itemID":2012,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":276,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://ac.els-cdn.com/S0167739X17310956/1-s2.0-S0167739X17310956-main.pdf?_tid=8c9eec2f-06b9-48d4-8617-395750d766a4&acdnat=1528722941_696353c98d09c17eb9e14f110625b2a5","accessDate":"2018-06-11T13:12:50Z","title":"Alemany et al_2018_Estimation of privacy risk through centrality metrics.pdf","parentItem":"4JW8N6FY","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Alemany et al_2018_Estimation of privacy risk through centrality metrics.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-11T13:12:50Z","dateModified":"2018-06-11T13:12:51Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/BZJ38VUD","itemID":2012,"key":"BZJ38VUD"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578764394,"version":0},"$loki":341},{"itemID":2017,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":173,"itemType":"conferencePaper","pages":"1-13","date":"April 2006","extra":"00346","DOI":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2006.154","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","conferenceName":"Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM 2006. 25TH IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications","abstractNote":"The performance of distributed networks depends on collaboration among distributed entities. To enhance security in distributed networks, such as ad hoc networks, it is important to evaluate the trustworthiness of participating entities since trust is the major driving force for collaboration. In this paper, we present a framework to quantitatively measure trust, model trust propagation, and defend trust evaluation systems against malicious attacks. In particular, we address the fundamental understanding of trust, quantitative trust metrics, mathematical properties of trust, dynamic properties of trust, and trust models. The attacks against trust evaluation are identified and defense techniques are developed. The proposed trust evaluation system is employed in ad hoc networks for securing ad hoc routing and assisting malicious node detection. The implementation is fully distributed. Simulations show that the proposed system can significantly improve network throughput as well as effectively detect malicious behaviors in ad hoc networks. Further, extensive simulations are performed to illustrate various attacks and the effectiveness of the proposed defense techniques.","title":"A trust evaluation framework in distributed networks: Vulnerability analysis and defense against attacks","proceedingsTitle":"Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM 2006. 25TH IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications","shortTitle":"A trust evaluation framework in distributed networks","creators":[{"firstName":"Y.

Such relationships are affected by a host of factors; trust is one of them. To enhance the quality of relationships in such networks, it is important to ﬁnd a mechanism to predict the degree of trust among participating agents since trust is the major driving force for initiating and developing social relationships. Although much effort has been made to develop quantitative techniques to obtain trust value, there is a lack of coherent classiﬁcation of such techniques to achieve a macro vision of trust prediction models and identify their strengths and weaknesses. In this paper, we proposed TP-TA, an analytical framework which consists of three main components: First, classiﬁcation of various existing trust prediction models in terms of trust aspects in the context of OSNs. Besides, main ideas, prospects, and challenges of each approach are highlighted for further research in this ﬁeld. Second, deﬁning general criteria to analyze our proposed classiﬁcation. Finally, we illustrate a qualitative comparison between each approach which is a guide to understanding their superiority to one another. This framework could lead to an efﬁcient selection of trust prediction techniques based on the nature of the target OSN and the intended trust type.","title":"TP-TA: a comparative analytical framework

Social or trust network among users provides an additional information along with the ratings for improving the user reliability on the recommendation. However, in real world, trust data is sparse in nature. So, many algorithms are built for inferring trust. In this paper, we propose a new trust inference method based on the implicit inﬂuence information available in the existing trust network. This approach uses the transitivity property of the trust for trust propagation and scale-free complex network property to limit the propagation length in the network. In this regard, we deﬁne a new terminology, degree of trustworthiness for a user, which adds the global inﬂuence in the inferred trust. This process improves the recommendation accuracy from the existing trustbased recommendation and neighborhood based collaborative ﬁltering. Due to the availability of users preference from trust network which is absent in rating data, it also alleviates the very well-known cold start users problem of a recommender system. We evaluate the proposed approach on two established real world datasets and report the obtained results.","title":"Trust Inference Using Implicit Influence for Item Recommendation","creators":[{"firstName":"Bithika","lastName":"Pal","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mamata","lastName":"Jenamani","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["J284H5UK"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-14T10:22:46Z","dateModified":"2018-07-26T20:33:06Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/EVDASNPA","attachments":[{"key":"J8RXG7YK","version":351,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Pal and Jenamani - 2017 - Trust Inference Using Implicit Influence for Item .pdf","parentItem":"EVDASNPA","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Pal and Jenamani - 2017 - Trust Inference Using Implicit Influence for Item .pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-14T10:22:44Z","dateModified":"2018-06-14T10:22:47Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":2580,"key":"EVDASNPA"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578764808,"version":0},"$loki":396},{"itemID":2579,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":351,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Pal and Jenamani - 2017 - Trust Inference Using Implicit Influence for Item .pdf","parentItem":"EVDASNPA","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Pal and Jenamani - 2017 - Trust Inference Using Implicit Influence for Item .pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-14T10:22:44Z","dateModified":"2018-06-14T10:22:47Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/J8RXG7YK","itemID":2579,"key":"J8RXG7YK"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578764808,"version":0},"$loki":397},{"itemID":2582,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":174,"itemType":"journalArticle","pages":"6","date":"2018","extra":"00000","libraryCatalog":"Zotero","language":"en","abstractNote":"To estimate the reliability of an unknown node in social networks, existing works involve as many opinions from other nodes as possible. Though this makes it possible to approximate the real property of the unknown nodes, the computational complexity increases as the scale of social networks getting bigger and bigger. We therefore propose a novel method which involve only limited number of social relations to predict the trustworthiness of the unknown nodes. The proposed method involves four rating prediction mechanisms: FM use the recommendation given by the most reliable recommender with the shortest trust propagation distance from the active user as the predicted rating, FMW weights the recommendation in FM, FA uses the mean value of recommendations with the shortest trust propagation distance from the active user as the predicted rating, and FAW weights recommendations in FA. The simulation results show that the proposed method can greatly reduce the rating prediction calculation, while the rating prediction losses are reasonable.","title":"Recommending with Limited Number of Trusted Users in Social Networks","creators":[{"firstName":"Weiwei","lastName":"Yuan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Donghai","lastName":"Guan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Asad Masood","lastName":"Khattak","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["J284H5UK"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-14T10:23:37Z","dateModified":"2018-07-26T20:33:07Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/N5B37YMG","attachments":[{"key":"ECRNEDDS","version":302,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Yuan et al. - 2018 - Recommending with Limited Number of Trusted Users .pdf","parentItem":"N5B37YMG","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Yuan et al. - 2018 - Recommending with Limited Number of Trusted Users .pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-14T10:23:35Z","dateModified":"2018-06-14T10:23:37Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":2582,"key":"N5B37YMG"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578764822,"version":0},"$loki":398},{"itemID":2581,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":302,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Yuan et al. - 2018 - Recommending with Limited Number of Trusted Users .pdf","parentItem":"N5B37YMG","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Yuan et al. - 2018 - Recommending with Limited Number of Trusted Users .pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-14T10:23:35Z","dateModified":"2018-06-14T10:23:37Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/ECRNEDDS","itemID":2581,"key":"ECRNEDDS"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578764822,"version":0},"$loki":399},{"itemID":2584,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":174,"itemType":"conferencePaper","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8367265/","publisher":"IEEE","pages":"182-189","ISBN":"978-1-5386-3790-6","date":"12/2017","extra":"00000","DOI":"10.1109/ISPA/IUCC.2017.00035","accessDate":"2018-06-14T10:24:43Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","language":"en","abstractNote":"Detecting inﬂuential nodes and understanding their evolution patterns are very important for information diffusion in online social networks. Although some work has been done in literature, it is still not clear that: (1) how to measure the inﬂuential degree of nodes for information diffusion, and (2) how inﬂuential nodes evolve during the diffusion process. To address the two challenges, we identify an incremental approach to measuring users’ inﬂuential degrees, detecting local and global inﬂuential nodes, and analyzing their evolution patterns, for which we propose three methods to partition time window. The three methods are the uniform time window, the non-uniform time window, and the uniform retweets number window, respectively. We apply our model on real data set in Sina weibo and conduct extensive analyses, from which we gain several interesting ﬁndings. We also validate the effects of our method, by comparing the inﬂuence spread with our detected inﬂuential nodes as seeds, to other seed selection algorithms, which shows that our work has better performance.","title":"Detecting Influential Nodes Incrementally and Evolutionarily in Online Social Networks","creators":[{"firstName":"Jingjing","lastName":"Wang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Wenjun","lastName":"Jiang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kenli","lastName":"Li","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Keqin","lastName":"Li","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["J284H5UK"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-14T10:24:43Z","dateModified":"2018-06-15T21:05:05Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/UFI4CUZ7","attachments":[{"key":"958DZM8F","version":243,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Wang et al. - 2017 - Detecting Influential Nodes Incrementally and Evol.pdf","parentItem":"UFI4CUZ7","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Wang et al. - 2017 - Detecting Influential Nodes Incrementally and Evol.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-14T10:24:41Z","dateModified":"2018-06-14T10:24:44Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":2584,"key":"UFI4CUZ7"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578764834,"version":0},"$loki":400},{"itemID":2583,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":243,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Wang et al. - 2017 - Detecting Influential Nodes Incrementally and Evol.pdf","parentItem":"UFI4CUZ7","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Wang et al. - 2017 - Detecting Influential Nodes Incrementally and Evol.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-14T10:24:41Z","dateModified":"2018-06-14T10:24:44Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/958DZM8F","itemID":2583,"key":"958DZM8F"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578764834,"version":0},"$loki":401},{"itemID":2616,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":119,"itemType":"attachment","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/8274985/08306424.pdf?tp=&arnumber=8306424&isnumber=8274985","accessDate":"2018-06-15T23:58:58Z","title":"Wang et al_2018_A Blockchain Based Privacy-Preserving Incentive Mechanism in Crowdsensing.pdf","parentItem":"UZSQ7AUT","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Wang et al_2018_A Blockchain Based Privacy-Preserving Incentive Mechanism in Crowdsensing.pdf","note":"<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"title\"><strong>Contents</strong></p><ul xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" style=\"list-style-type: none;

The Entropy model identiﬁes the most interesting and important nodes in a graph. We show how entropy models on graphs are relevant to study of information ﬂow in an organization.

However, few attempts have been made on reasoning about differential privacy at a system level. In this paper, we propose a formal framework to verify differential privacy in probabilistic systems. With a metric on the states of a system, we formalize differential privacy by the ratio of the probabilities in the distributions after the same labeled transitions of relevant states. We explain how traditional differential privacy can be embedded in our framework and raise an inﬁmum metric, the least distance between two states, while not violating differential privacy. It is proven that the inﬁmum metric is also a metric instance of differential privacy itself. Furthermore, we propose a two-level logic, a privacy variant of the familiar Hennessy–Milner logic, to characterize differential privacy in our framework. Our results have close relations to probabilistic bisimilarity as well.","title":"Differential privacy in probabilistic systems","creators":[{"firstName":"Jiannan","lastName":"Yang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yongzhi","lastName":"Cao","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Hanpin","lastName":"Wang","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-28T14:23:50Z","dateModified":"2018-08-28T14:23:50Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/7BHPVT4U","attachments":[{"key":"3KV998UT","version":203,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Yang et al. - 2017 - Differential privacy in probabilistic systems.pdf","parentItem":"7BHPVT4U","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Yang et al. - 2017 - Differential privacy in probabilistic systems.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-28T14:23:39Z","dateModified":"2018-08-28T14:23:50Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":2924,"key":"7BHPVT4U"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578765048,"version":0},"$loki":428},{"itemID":2913,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":203,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Yang et al. - 2017 - Differential privacy in probabilistic systems.pdf","parentItem":"7BHPVT4U","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Yang et al. - 2017 - Differential privacy in probabilistic systems.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-28T14:23:39Z","dateModified":"2018-08-28T14:23:50Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/3KV998UT","itemID":2913,"key":"3KV998UT"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578765048,"version":0},"$loki":429},{"itemID":2926,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":175,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00327","volume":"51","issue":"3","pages":"1-38","publicationTitle":"ACM Computing Surveys","ISSN":"03600300","date":"2018-06-12","extra":"00031 \narXiv: 1512.00327","DOI":"10.1145/3168389","accessDate":"2018-08-28T14:23:55Z","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","language":"en","abstractNote":"The goal of privacy metrics is to measure the degree of privacy enjoyed by users in a system and the amount of protection oﬀered by privacy-enhancing technologies. In this way, privacy metrics contribute to improving user privacy in the digital world. The diversity and complexity of privacy metrics in the literature makes an informed choice of metrics challenging. As a result, redundant new metrics are proposed frequently, and privacy studies are often incomparable. In this survey we alleviate these problems by structuring the landscape of privacy metrics. For this we explain and discuss a selection of over eighty privacy metrics and introduce a categorization based on the aspect of privacy they measure, their required inputs, and the type of data that needs protection. In addition, we present a method on how to choose privacy metrics based on eight questions that help identify the right privacy metrics for a given scenario, and highlight topics where additional work on privacy metrics is needed. Our survey spans multiple privacy domains and can be understood as a general framework for privacy measurement.","title":"Technical Privacy Metrics: a Systematic Survey","shortTitle":"Technical Privacy Metrics","creators":[{"firstName":"Isabel","lastName":"Wagner","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"David","lastName":"Eckhoff","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Computer Science - Cryptography and Security","type":1},{"tag":"Computer Science - Information Theory","type":1},{"tag":"Computer Science - Performance","type":1}],"collections":["D2M4DBVZ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-28T14:23:55Z","dateModified":"2018-08-28T14:23:55Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/YXF2A4PN","attachments":[{"key":"4VKQY9VN","version":210,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Wagner and Eckhoff - 2018 - Technical Privacy Metrics a Systematic Survey.pdf","parentItem":"YXF2A4PN","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Wagner and Eckhoff - 2018 - Technical Privacy Metrics a Systematic Survey.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-28T14:23:38Z","dateModified":"2018-08-28T14:23:55Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":2926,"key":"YXF2A4PN"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578765062,"version":0},"$loki":430},{"itemID":2910,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":210,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Wagner and Eckhoff - 2018 - Technical Privacy Metrics a Systematic Survey.pdf","parentItem":"YXF2A4PN","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Wagner and Eckhoff - 2018 - Technical Privacy Metrics a Systematic Survey.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-28T14:23:38Z","dateModified":"2018-08-28T14:23:55Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/4VKQY9VN","itemID":2910,"key":"4VKQY9VN"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578765064,"version":0},"$loki":431},{"itemID":2950,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":175,"itemType":"conferencePaper","url":"http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1753326.1753559","place":"Atlanta, Georgia, USA","publisher":"ACM Press","pages":"1553","ISBN":"978-1-60558-929-9","date":"2010","extra":"00274","DOI":"10.1145/1753326.1753559","accessDate":"2018-09-10T12:40:35Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","conferenceName":"the 28th international conference","language":"en","abstractNote":"Privacy practices in social network sites often appear paradoxical, as content-sharing behavior stands in conflict with the need to reduce disclosure-related harms. In this study we explore privacy in social network sites as a contextual information practice, managed by a process of boundary regulation. Drawing on a sample survey of undergraduate Facebook users, we examine a particular privacy-enhancing practice: having a friends-only Facebook profile. Particularly, we look at the association between network composition, expectancy violations, interpersonal privacy practices and having a friends-only profile. We find that expectancy violations by weak ties and increased levels of interpersonal privacy management are positively associated with having a friends-only profile. We conclude with a discussion of how these findings may be integrated into the design of systems to facilitate interaction while enhancing individual privacy.","title":"Friends only: examining a privacy-enhancing behavior in facebook","proceedingsTitle":"Proceedings of the 28th international conference on Human factors in computing systems - CHI '10","shortTitle":"Friends only","creators":[{"firstName":"Fred","lastName":"Stutzman","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jacob","lastName":"Kramer-Duffield","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["JA9I9PG8"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-09-10T12:40:35Z","dateModified":"2018-09-10T12:40:35Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/THFX9UQG","attachments":[{"key":"5QPWN3FZ","version":216,"itemType":"attachment","url":"http://fredstutzman.com/papers/CHI2010_Stutzman.pdf","accessDate":"2018-09-10T12:40:34Z","title":"Stutzman and Kramer-Duffield - 2010 - Friends only examining a privacy-enhancing behavi.pdf","parentItem":"THFX9UQG","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Stutzman and Kramer-Duffield - 2010 - Friends only examining a privacy-enhancing behavi.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-09-10T12:40:34Z","dateModified":"2018-09-10T12:40:36Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":2950,"key":"THFX9UQG"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578765156,"version":0},"$loki":440},{"itemID":2949,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":216,"itemType":"attachment","url":"http://fredstutzman.com/papers/CHI2010_Stutzman.pdf","accessDate":"2018-09-10T12:40:34Z","title":"Stutzman and Kramer-Duffield - 2010 - Friends only examining a privacy-enhancing behavi.pdf","parentItem":"THFX9UQG","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Stutzman and Kramer-Duffield - 2010 - Friends only examining a privacy-enhancing behavi.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-09-10T12:40:34Z","dateModified":"2018-09-10T12:40:36Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/5QPWN3FZ","itemID":2949,"key":"5QPWN3FZ"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578765156,"version":0},"$loki":441},{"itemID":2957,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":175,"itemType":"journalArticle","pages":"1-1","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys Tutorials","ISSN":"1553-877X","date":"2018","extra":"00000","DOI":"10.1109/COMST.2018.2855563","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","abstractNote":"As the deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) is experiencing an exponential growth, it is no surprise that many recent cyber attacks are IoT-enabled: The attacker initially exploits some vulnerable IoT technology as a first step towards compromising a critical system that is connected, in some way, with the IoT. For some sectors, like industry, smart grids, transportation and medical services, the significance of such attacks is obvious, since IoT technologies are part of critical back-end systems. However, in sectors where IoT is usually at the end-user side, like smart homes, such attacks can be underestimated, since not all possible attack paths are examined. In this paper we survey IoT-enabled cyber attacks, found in all application domains since 2010. For each sector, we emphasize on the latest, verified IoT-enabled attacks, based on known real-world incidents and published proof-of-concept attacks. We methodologically analyze representative attacks that demonstrate direct, indirect and subliminal attack paths against critical targets. Our goal is threefold: (i) To assess IoT-enabled cyber attacks in a risk-like approach, in order to demonstrate their current threat landscape; (ii) To identify hidden and subliminal IoT-enabled attack paths against critical infrastructures and services, and (iii) To examine mitigation strategies for all application domains.","title":"A Survey of IoT-enabled Cyberattacks: Assessing Attack

Providing relevant information to the users to cater to their needs is the primary goal of website owners. Therefore, ﬁnding the content of the Web and retrieving the users’ interests and needs from their behavior have become increasingly important. Web mining is used to categorize users and pages by analyzing the users’ behavior, the content of the pages, and the order of the URLs that tend to be accessed in order. Web structure mining plays an important role in this approach. Two page ranking algorithms, HITS and PageRank, are commonly used in web structure mining. Both algorithms treat all links equally when distributing rank scores. Several algorithms have been developed to improve the performance of these methods. The Weighted PageRank algorithm (WPR), an extension to the standard PageRank algorithm, is introduced in this paper. WPR takes into account the importance of both the inlinks and the outlinks of the pages and distributes rank scores based on the popularity of the pages. The results of our simulation studies show that WPR performs better than the conventional PageRank algorithm in terms of returning larger number of relevant pages to a given query.","title":"Weighted PageRank algorithm","proceedingsTitle":"Proceedings.

This article is concerned with studying the time-asymptotic behaviour of the extended contact processes on static, undirected, ﬁnite-size networks. This is a contact process with nonzero exogenous infection rate (also known as the -susceptible-infectedsusceptible model). The only known analytical characterization of the equilibrium distribution of this process is for complete networks. For large networks with arbitrary topology, it is infeasible to numerically solve for the equilibrium distribution since it requires solving the eigenvalue-eigenvector problem of a matrix that is exponential in N, the size of the network. We derive a condition on the infection rates under which, depending on the degree distribution of the network, the equilibrium distribution of extended contact processes on arbitrary, ﬁnite-size networks is well approximated by a closed-form formulation. We conﬁrm the goodness of the approximation with small networks answering inference questions like the distribution of the percentage of infected individuals and the most-probable equilibrium conﬁguration. We then use the approximation to analyse the equilibrium distribution of the extended contact process on the 4941-node US Western power grid.","title":"Contact process with exogenous infection and the scaled SIS process","creators":[{"firstName":"","lastName":"Zhang","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["THXI4EZV"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-11-29T11:09:44Z","dateModified":"2018-11-29T15:31:57Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/7RQYSN68","attachments":[{"key":"L8DGFS4R","version":373,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://watermark.silverchair.com/cnx003.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAk8wggJLBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggI8MIICOAIBADCCAjEGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMQ4q1aSX4QHx0MQBnAgEQgIICAgDJbI_tXx-7mjcYkZv9kJCJAndhONjGsv6-S8p6OPaqMHydnqqi_UB9dHwvkPGJGpvoqYcJbMa2soNxDmlTUynE9KtLtPfsvfNW5n5e0v3_NywgfV3pwEApECPnXfdNHkJh6jVPmq2I0v4u_Hfg80He8jwrCzttubF88G9SS8PspCkPIBbhulkMcSumxJrXO00Ryj_ybSO1cHZlVx6R3NZmCvfZcI3oXHSeozSr1BCtSDoSMRMNIKCSdYoEQOMoadNq5IuYvNHvhsGe77tmFLHsYS9bCiUJRlgvsHKoU31Fm3_0O3E38Zp97wTM4Sx9ypZBQmqVwL6lEw-ZGEDNhKb32yN1TQCUAIL0FF9Gk7U6j1JgjWjYFf90w9DL2O1X5QcB3uYUCvpjUk9ydJ20xroTyt3gauUYLQmZZ4jH6UMd_TBc5A87qvMsvxJjBORu4P64Wm6EkKsGo4ibxedO2MV_7J3Gf0FP_cioZ6TNxVRl6QlE--sV-fzb2mEzinGd3f1nuBe01SqSZwaM9vdlqhz8dsqlXlvYiJqTv_GpsFE4QE-prtIbrkLh1XA9faZHpwGfJsEf4dCEhtK571d_SOkucqREPmRBe4mbsP5g0OX-zyysENsCvfZ8jZAwkEC7VwWQThx78xYyfpkWJXgOg5NqN4f3CCZCcbe5INXB_OBSnNs","accessDate":"2018-11-29T11:09:42Z","title":"2017 - OUP accepted manuscript.pdf","parentItem":"7RQYSN68","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"2017 - OUP accepted manuscript.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-11-29T11:09:42Z","dateModified":"2018-11-29T11:09:45Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":3107,"key":"7RQYSN68"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578765740,"version":0},"$loki":488},{"itemID":3106,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":373,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://watermark.silverchair.com/cnx003.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAk8wggJLBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggI8MIICOAIBADCCAjEGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMQ4q1aSX4QHx0MQBnAgEQgIICAgDJbI_tXx-7mjcYkZv9kJCJAndhONjGsv6-S8p6OPaqMHydnqqi_UB9dHwvkPGJGpvoqYcJbMa2soNxDmlTUynE9KtLtPfsvfNW5n5e0v3_NywgfV3pwEApECPnXfdNHkJh6jVPmq2I0v4u_Hfg80He8jwrCzttubF88G9SS8PspCkPIBbhulkMcSumxJrXO00Ryj_ybSO1cHZlVx6R3NZmCvfZcI3oXHSeozSr1BCtSDoSMRMNIKCSdYoEQOMoadNq5IuYvNHvhsGe77tmFLHsYS9bCiUJRlgvsHKoU31Fm3_0O3E38Zp97wTM4Sx9ypZBQmqVwL6lEw-ZGEDNhKb32yN1TQCUAIL0FF9Gk7U6j1JgjWjYFf90w9DL2O1X5QcB3uYUCvpjUk9ydJ20xroTyt3gauUYLQmZZ4jH6UMd_TBc5A87qvMsvxJjBORu4P64Wm6EkKsGo4ibxedO2MV_7J3Gf0FP_cioZ6TNxVRl6QlE--sV-fzb2mEzinGd3f1nuBe01SqSZwaM9vdlqhz8dsqlXlvYiJqTv_GpsFE4QE-prtIbrkLh1XA9faZHpwGfJsEf4dCEhtK571d_SOkucqREPmRBe4mbsP5g0OX-zyysENsCvfZ8jZAwkEC7VwWQThx78xYyfpkWJXgOg5NqN4f3CCZCcbe5INXB_OBSnNs","accessDate":"2018-11-29T11:09:42Z","title":"2017 - OUP accepted manuscript.pdf","parentItem":"7RQYSN68","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"2017 - OUP accepted manuscript.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-11-29T11:09:42Z","dateModified":"2018-11-29T11:09:45Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/L8DGFS4R","itemID":3106,"key":"L8DGFS4R"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578765742,"version":0},"$loki":489},{"itemID":3113,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":219,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7421402","accessDate":"2018-11-29T15:13:23Z","title":"IEEE Xplore Abstract Record","parentItem":"XM8N6W9R","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"7421402.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-11-29T15:13:23Z","dateModified":"2018-11-29T15:13:23Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/5SPLBZYC","itemID":3113,"key":"5SPLBZYC"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578765754,"version":0},"$loki":491},{"itemID":3115,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":176,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"https://academic.oup.com/comnet/article/3/4/584/775753","volume":"3","issue":"4","pages":"584-605","publicationTitle":"Journal of Complex Networks","ISSN":"2051-1310","date":"2015/12/01","extra":"00008","journalAbbreviation":"J Complex Netw","DOI":"10.1093/comnet/cnv006","accessDate":"2018-11-29T15:30:51Z","libraryCatalog":"academic.oup.com","language":"en","abstractNote":"Abstract.

There are two limiting cases widely analyzed in the physics literature, the so-called contact process (CP) where the contagion is expanded at a certain rate from an infected vertex to one neighbor at a time, and the reactive process (RP) in which an infected individual eﬀectively contacts all its neighbors to expand the epidemics. However, a more realistic scenario is obtained from the interpolation between these two cases, considering a certain number of stochastic contacts per unit time. Here we propose a discrete-time formulation of the problem of contact-based epidemic spreading. We resolve a family of models, parameterized by the number of stochastic contact trials per unit time, that range from the CP to the RP. In contrast to the common heterogeneous mean-ﬁeld approach, we focus on the probability of infection of individual nodes. Using this formulation, we can construct the whole phase diagram of the diﬀerent infection models and determine their critical properties.","title":"Discrete-time Markov chain approach to contact-based disease spreading in complex networks","creators":[{"firstName":"S.","lastName":"Gomez","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"A.","lastName":"Arenas","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"J.","lastName":"Borge-Holthoefer","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"S.","lastName":"Meloni","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Y.","lastName":"Moreno","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Physics - Computational Physics","type":1},{"tag":"Physics - Physics and Society","type":1}],"collections":["28M75EK7"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-11-30T14:50:29Z","dateModified":"2018-11-30T14:50:30Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/EHJYS7JH","attachments":[{"key":"IZSZCTG5","version":348,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/0907.1313v2.pdf","accessDate":"2018-11-30T14:49:15Z","title":"Gomez et al. - 2010 - Discrete-time Markov chain approach to contact-bas.pdf","parentItem":"EHJYS7JH","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Gomez et al. - 2010 - Discrete-time Markov chain approach to contact-bas.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-11-30T14:49:15Z","dateModified":"2018-11-30T14:50:30Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":3123,"key":"EHJYS7JH"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578765796,"version":0},"$loki":498},{"itemID":3122,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":348,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/0907.1313v2.pdf","accessDate":"2018-11-30T14:49:15Z","title":"Gomez et al. - 2010 - Discrete-time Markov chain approach to contact-bas.pdf","parentItem":"EHJYS7JH","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Gomez et al. - 2010 - Discrete-time Markov chain approach to contact-bas.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-11-30T14:49:15Z","dateModified":"2018-11-30T14:50:30Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/IZSZCTG5","itemID":3122,"key":"IZSZCTG5"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578765796,"version":0},"$loki":499},{"itemID":3130,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":227,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Accettura et al. - 2015 - Decentralized Traffic Aware Scheduling in 6TiSCH N.pdf","parentItem":"XH9LNRR6","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Accettura et al. - 2015 - Decentralized Traffic Aware Scheduling in 6TiSCH N.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-14T14:41:58Z","dateModified":"2018-12-14T14:42:02Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/74P8QFEX","itemID":3130,"key":"74P8QFEX"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578765838,"version":0},"$loki":503},{"itemID":3138,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":176,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212017316304868","series":"1st Global Colloquium on Recent Advancements and Effectual Researches in Engineering, Science and Technology - RAEREST 2016 on April 22 & 23 April 2016","volume":"25","pages":"513-519","publicationTitle":"Procedia Technology","ISSN":"2212-0173","date":"January 1, 2016","extra":"00000","journalAbbreviation":"Procedia Technology","DOI":"10.1016/j.protcy.2016.08.139","accessDate":"2018-12-18T13:05:15Z","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","abstractNote":"In the proposed system, implementation of the low power sensor nodes is proposed. 6LoWPAN is an acronym of IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Network was developed to enable the Wireless Embedded Internet by simplifying IPv6 functionality, defining very compact header formats and taking the nature of wireless networks into account.

They illuminate the features in describing the properties of causality and concurrency. Moreover, it is well known that a synchronized TPN (STPN) allows us to present all of the concurrent states in a complex TPN. In this paper, we propose a new methodology to design and analyze an urban traffic network control system by using the STPN. In addition, the applications of the STPN to eight-phase, six-phase, and two-phase traffic-light control systems are modularized. The advantage of the proposed approach is the clear presentation of the behaviors of traffic lights in terms of the conditions and events that cause phase alternations. Moreover, the size of the urban traffic network control system can be easily extended with our proposed modular technique. An analysis of the control models is performed via a reachability graph method to demonstrate how the models enforce the transitions of the traffic lights.","title":"Modular Design of Urban Traffic-Light Control Systems Based on Synchronized Timed Petri Nets","creators":[{"firstName":"Y.","lastName":"Huang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Y.","lastName":"Weng","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"M.","lastName":"Zhou","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Analytical models","type":1},{"tag":"causality property","type":1},{"tag":"concurrency property","type":1},{"tag":"control system synthesis","type":1},{"tag":"Control systems","type":1},{"tag":"discrete event dynamic systems","type":1},{"tag":"eight-phase traffic-light control systems","type":1},{"tag":"Modular","type":1},{"tag":"modular design","type":1},{"tag":"Petri net (PN)","type":1},{"tag":"Petri nets","type":1},{"tag":"reachability analysis","type":1},{"tag":"reachability graph method","type":1},{"tag":"road traffic control","type":1},{"tag":"Roads","type":1},{"tag":"Safety","type":1},{"tag":"six-phase traffic-light control systems","type":1},{"tag":"STPN","type":1},{"tag":"Synchronization","type":1},{"tag":"synchronized timed Petri nets","type":1},{"tag":"traffic control systems","type":1},{"tag":"traffic light behavior","type":1},{"tag":"traffic lights transition","type":1},{"tag":"traffic network","type":1},{"tag":"two-phase traffic-light control systems","type":1},{"tag":"urban traffic light control systems","type":1},{"tag":"urban traffic network control system","type":1},{"tag":"Vehicles","type":1}],"collections":["TFCFA8KG"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T13:13:27Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T13:13:28Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/Z3ULG3CT","attachments":[{"key":"J7VXHP34","version":349,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6979/6782656/06662483.pdf?tp=&arnumber=6662483&isnumber=6782656","accessDate":"2018-12-18T13:13:31Z","title":"Huang et al_2014_Modular Design of Urban Traffic-Light Control Systems Based on Synchronized.pdf","parentItem":"Z3ULG3CT","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Huang et al_2014_Modular Design of Urban Traffic-Light Control Systems Based on Synchronized.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T13:13:31Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T13:13:32Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":3145,"key":"Z3ULG3CT"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578765926,"version":0},"$loki":510},{"itemID":3146,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":349,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6979/6782656/06662483.pdf?tp=&arnumber=6662483&isnumber=6782656","accessDate":"2018-12-18T13:13:31Z","title":"Huang et al_2014_Modular Design of Urban Traffic-Light Control Systems Based on Synchronized.pdf","parentItem":"Z3ULG3CT","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Huang et al_2014_Modular Design of Urban Traffic-Light Control Systems Based on Synchronized.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T13:13:31Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T13:13:32Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/J7VXHP34","itemID":3146,"key":"J7VXHP34"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578765926,"version":0},"$loki":511},{"itemID":3149,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":176,"itemType":"conferencePaper","date":"2015","extra":"00006","libraryCatalog":"Semantic Scholar","abstractNote":"The Internet of Things is an emerging topic of technical, social, and economic significance. Consumer products, durable goods, cars and trucks, industrial and utility components, sensors, and other everyday objects are being combined with Internet connectivity and powerful data analytic capabilities that promise to transform the way we work, live, and play. Projections for the impact of IoT on the Internet and economy are impressive, with some anticipating as many as 100 billion connected IoT devices and a global economic impact of more than $11 trillion by 2025. At the same time, however, the Internet of Things raises significant challenges that could stand in the way of realizing its potential benefits. Attention-grabbing headlines about the hacking of Internet-connected devices, surveillance concerns, and privacy fears already have captured public attention. Technical challenges remain and new policy, legal and development challenges are emerging. This overview document is designed to help the Internet Society community navigate the dialogue surrounding the Internet of Things in light of the competing predictions about its promises and perils. The Internet of Things engages a broad set of ideas that are complex and intertwined from different perspectives. Key concepts that serve as a foundation for exploring the opportunities and challenges of IoT include: • IoT Definitions: The term Internet of Things generally refers to scenarios where network connectivity and computing capability extends to objects, sensors and everyday items not normally considered computers, allowing these devices to generate, exchange and consume data with minimal human intervention. There is, however, no single, universal definition. • Enabling Technologies: The concept of combining computers, sensors, and networks to monitor and control devices has existed for decades. The recent confluence of several technology market trends, however, is bringing the Internet of Things closer to widespread reality. These include Ubiquitous Connectivity, Widespread Adoption of IP-based Networking, Computing Economics, Miniaturization, Advances in Data Analytics, and the Rise of Cloud Computing. • Connectivity Models: IoT implementations use different technical communications models, each with its own characteristics. Four common communications models described by the Internet Architecture Board include: Device-to-Device, Device-to-Cloud, Device-to-Gateway, and Back-End Data-Sharing. These models highlight the flexibility in the ways that IoT devices can connect and provide value to the user. • Transformational Potential: If the projections and trends towards IoT become reality, it may force a shift in thinking about the implications and issues in a world where the most common interaction with the …","title":"THE INTERNET OF THINGS : AN OVERVIEW Understanding the Issues and Challenges of a More Connected World","shortTitle":"THE INTERNET OF THINGS","creators":[{"firstName":"Karen","lastName":"Rose","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Scott D.","lastName":"Eldridge","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Lyman","lastName":"Chapin","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"benefit","type":1},{"tag":"Cloud computing","type":1},{"tag":"Computer","type":1},{"tag":"Computers","type":1},{"tag":"Confluence","type":1},{"tag":"Greater Than","type":1},{"tag":"Internet Architecture Board","type":1},{"tag":"Internet of things","type":1},{"tag":"Physical object","type":1},{"tag":"Projections and Predictions","type":1},{"tag":"sensor (device)","type":1},{"tag":"Technical standard","type":1}],"collections":["TFCFA8KG"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T13:39:27Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T13:39:28Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/7KBVERHE","attachments":[{"key":"A8BN2V3I","version":253,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/df53/501af80026c4379a3467b551caaf7589a1db.pdf","accessDate":"2018-12-18T13:39:28Z","title":"Rose et al_2015_THE INTERNET OF THINGS.pdf","parentItem":"7KBVERHE","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Rose et al_2015_THE INTERNET OF THINGS.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T13:39:28Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T13:39:29Z"},{"key":"3UKDREH4","version":184,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/THE-INTERNET-OF-THINGS-%3A-AN-OVERVIEW-Understanding-Rose-Eldridge/6d12bda69e8fcbbf1e9a10471b54e57b15cb07f6","accessDate":"2018-12-18T13:39:28Z","title":"Semantic Scholar Link","parentItem":"7KBVERHE","linkMode":"linked_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T13:39:28Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T13:39:28Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":3149,"key":"7KBVERHE"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578765946,"version":0},"$loki":512},{"itemID":3151,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":253,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/df53/501af80026c4379a3467b551caaf7589a1db.pdf","accessDate":"2018-12-18T13:39:28Z","title":"Rose et al_2015_THE INTERNET OF THINGS.pdf","parentItem":"7KBVERHE","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Rose et al_2015_THE INTERNET OF THINGS.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T13:39:28Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T13:39:29Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/A8BN2V3I","itemID":3151,"key":"A8BN2V3I"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578765946,"version":0},"$loki":513},{"itemID":3163,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":176,"itemType":"journalArticle","pages":"5","libraryCatalog":"Zotero","language":"en","abstractNote":"Fractional Lambda (λ) Switching (FλS™) adds the necessary efficiency to Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) while preserving the simplicity of whole λ switching.

This difﬁculty stems from the fact that packet scheduling decisions at each hop inﬂuences and are inﬂuenced by decisions on other hops and only a few provably efﬁcient online scheduling algorithms exist in the multihop setting. We consider a general multihop wired network topology in which packets with various deadlines and weights arrive at and are destined to different nodes through given routes. We study the problem of joint admission control and packet scheduling in order to maximize the cumulative weights of the packets that reach their destinations within their deadlines. We ﬁrst focus on uplink transmissions in the tree topology and show that the well known earliest deadline ﬁrst algorithm achieves the same performance as the optimal off-line algorithm for any feasible arrival pattern. We then address the general topology with multiple source-destination pairs, develop a simple online algorithm and show that it is O(PM log PM )competitive where PM is the maximum route length among all packets. Our algorithm only requires information along the route of each packet and our result is valid for general arrival samples. Via numerical results, we show that our algorithm achieves performance that is comparable to the non-causal optimal offline algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst algorithm with a provable (based on a sample-path construction) competitive ratio, subject to hard deadline constraints for general network topologies.","title":"Online Packet Scheduling with Hard Deadlines in Wired Networks","creators":[{"firstName":"Zhoujia","lastName":"Mao","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"C Emre","lastName":"Koksal","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ness B","lastName":"Shroff","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["8GE7IDJI"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:25:58Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:25:58Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/2JB4LGK5","attachments":[{"key":"54CHPJVR","version":213,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Mao et al. - Online Packet Scheduling with Hard Deadlines in Wi.pdf","parentItem":"2JB4LGK5","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Mao et al. - Online Packet Scheduling with Hard Deadlines in Wi.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:25:51Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:25:58Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":3167,"key":"2JB4LGK5"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578766020,"version":0},"$loki":523},{"itemID":3158,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":213,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Mao et al. - Online Packet Scheduling with Hard Deadlines in Wi.pdf","parentItem":"2JB4LGK5","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Mao et al. - Online Packet Scheduling with Hard Deadlines in Wi.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:25:51Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:25:58Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/54CHPJVR","itemID":3158,"key":"54CHPJVR"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578766022,"version":0},"$loki":524},{"itemID":3168,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":176,"itemType":"conferencePaper","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/812444/","volume":"4","place":"Tokyo, Japan","publisher":"IEEE","pages":"441-446","ISBN":"978-0-7803-5731-0","date":"1999","extra":"00007","DOI":"10.1109/ICSMC.1999.812444","accessDate":"2018-12-18T22:25:59Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","conferenceName":"IEEE SMC'99 Conference Proceedings. 1999 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","language":"en","abstractNote":"In this paper, Periodic Job-Shop-Scheduling Problem (PJSSP) extended from Job-Shop-Scheduling Problem (JSSP) is considered.

While it is obvious that any instrument for the measurement of time operates according to a discrete time scale, due to its finite precision, and that most interesting modern systems, being digital in nature, intrinsicallyuse a discrete time scale, models often use a continuous time scale. The reason for this discrepancy lies in the greater simplicity of continuous time models. Indeed, if the time axis is discrete, the model has to consider the fact that multiple events may occur between two consecutive time marks, and explore the effect of all possible combinations among these events. In the continuous time scale, instead, using appropriate probabilistic assumptions, it is possible to univocally order events, so that it is always possible to take into consideration only one event at a time.","title":"Stochastic Petri nets: An elementary introduction","bookTitle":"Advances in Petri Nets 1989","shortTitle":"Stochastic Petri nets","creators":[{"firstName":"G.","lastName":"Goos","creatorType":"seriesEditor"},{"firstName":"J.","lastName":"Hartmanis","creatorType":"seriesEditor"},{"firstName":"D.","lastName":"Barstow","creatorType":"seriesEditor"},{"firstName":"W.","lastName":"Brauer","creatorType":"seriesEditor"},{"firstName":"P.","lastName":"Brinch Hansen","creatorType":"seriesEditor"},{"firstName":"D.","lastName":"Gries","creatorType":"seriesEditor"},{"firstName":"D.","lastName":"Luckham","creatorType":"seriesEditor"},{"firstName":"C.","lastName":"Moler","creatorType":"seriesEditor"},{"firstName":"A.","lastName":"Pnueli","creatorType":"seriesEditor"},{"firstName":"G.","lastName":"Seegmüller","creatorType":"seriesEditor"},{"firstName":"J.","lastName":"Stoer","creatorType":"seriesEditor"},{"firstName":"N.","lastName":"Wirth","creatorType":"seriesEditor"},{"firstName":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Rozenberg","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"M.

On the other hand, the development of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) as well as safety systems that takes advantages of these communications. Additionally, the V2V communications systems are mainly focused to cars and trucks, showing less concern for Vulnerable Road Users, pedestrians, motorcyclists and cyclists.

The corpus of geotagged posts from OSNs includes people’s feedbacks about a wide range of topics, with precise temporal and geographical metadata, that can be used as a support or an improvement to hardware sensors. For instance, if collocated people, independently and at the same time, write posts complaining about high temperatures, it could effectively denote a raise of heat in that place. In this paper, we explore the feasibility to use a geographical search on social networks, that is, a geosocial search, about air pollution related posts, as effective air impureness measurements. We evaluate our assumption in large cities over three continents of the planet, where a minimum increment about the number of air pollution related posts in an area, indeed corresponds to a raise of minimum pollution values in such area. Such a correlation can be exploited to integrate and extend existing air pollution monitoring networks. At the end of the manuscript we propose to further employ the time series of posts returned by the geosocial search to predict next pollution values.","title":"Using geosocial search for urban air pollution monitoring","creators":[{"firstName":"Matteo","lastName":"Sammarco","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Rita","lastName":"Tse","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Giovanni","lastName":"Pau","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Gustavo","lastName":"Marfia","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["BUQ52EQ6"],"relations":{"dc:replaces":["http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/JCDG2AMF"]},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:28:31Z","dateModified":"2019-01-19T17:00:40Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/7TEEFV5R","attachments":[{"key":"IQPAFITD","version":345,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Sammarco et al. -

However, due to the most existing map-matching algorithms that are based on high sampling rate, when the sampling interval is increased, the correct rate of the algorithm will be greatly reduced. Based on this, this paper proposed a new algorithm of map-matching for low sampling rate GPS trajectories. The algorithm gave full consideration to the road network of the geometric structure and topological structure and the mutual influence between adjacent points (time, speed information) by calculating the probability of each trajectory point of candidate points to determine matching results. At the end of this paper, we use the data of Beijing UCAR Inc.’s car in a case study. This case demonstrates: For low sampling rate matching track points in the complex road, the algorithm has a good uptime, and an exact match was found.","title":"A novel algorithm of low sampling rate GPS trajectories on map-matching","creators":[{"firstName":"Yankai","lastName":"Liu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Zhuo","lastName":"Li","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["2QRYPJQZ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:30:05Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:30:05Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/JVB2DZXW","attachments":[{"key":"IFHB6A8F","version":341,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Liu and Li - 2017 - A novel algorithm of low sampling rate GPS traject.pdf","parentItem":"JVB2DZXW","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Liu and Li - 2017 - A novel algorithm of low sampling rate GPS traject.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:30:00Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:30:05Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":3207,"key":"JVB2DZXW"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578766472,"version":0},"$loki":579},{"itemID":3203,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":341,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Liu and Li - 2017 - A novel algorithm of low sampling rate GPS traject.pdf","parentItem":"JVB2DZXW","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Liu and Li - 2017 - A novel algorithm of low sampling rate GPS traject.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:30:00Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:30:05Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/IFHB6A8F","itemID":3203,"key":"IFHB6A8F"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578766474,"version":0},"$loki":580},{"itemID":3212,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":177,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"http://www.hindawi.com/journals/tswj/2014/218246/","volume":"2014","pages":"1-11","publicationTitle":"The Scientific World Journal","ISSN":"2356-6140, 1537-744X","date":"2014","extra":"00002","DOI":"10.1155/2014/218246","accessDate":"2018-12-18T22:31:03Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","language":"en","title":"Advanced Emergency Braking Controller Design for Pedestrian Protection Oriented Automotive Collision Avoidance System","creators":[{"firstName":"Guo","lastName":"Lie","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ren","lastName":"Zejian","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ge","lastName":"Pingshu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Chang","lastName":"Jing","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["RD8CJ48G"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:31:03Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:31:03Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/NVN5CXR2","attachments":[{"key":"H32JVA38","version":327,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Lie et al. - 2014 - Advanced Emergency Braking Controller Design for P.pdf","parentItem":"NVN5CXR2","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Lie et al. - 2014 - Advanced Emergency Braking Controller Design for P.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:31:00Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:31:03Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":3212,"key":"NVN5CXR2"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578766486,"version":0},"$loki":581},{"itemID":3208,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":327,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Lie et al. - 2014 - Advanced Emergency Braking Controller Design for P.pdf","parentItem":"NVN5CXR2","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Lie et al. - 2014 - Advanced Emergency Braking Controller Design for P.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:31:00Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:31:03Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/H32JVA38","itemID":3208,"key":"H32JVA38"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578766488,"version":0},"$loki":582},{"itemID":3213,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":177,"itemType":"journalArticle","pages":"11","extra":"00000","libraryCatalog":"Zotero","language":"en","abstractNote":"Current research in Intelligent Transport Systems is focussing on informing cars to make traffic more efficient and safer. However vulnerable road users are not involved or informed. In order to prevent collisions with vulnerable road users cars make use of collision avoidance systems. These systems are mainly based on camera, infrared and/or radar sensors and suffer from difficulties like road users hidden by cars and buildings. These collision prevention systems are mainly autonomous systems and are not cooperating with other detection systems. We propose to extend CALM, the communication standard for cooperative vehicular systems (16), with a local communication system for protection devices for vulnerable road users. These systems can be integrated into existing systems like bicycle navigation systems and/or smartphones. For devices which cannot rely on a navigation system we propose to use position estimation, based on the position of neighbouring devices, like parked cars, roadside units or smart devices.","title":"ARCHITECTURE FOR VULNERABLE ROAD USER COLLISION PREVENTION SYSTEM (VRU-CPS), BASED ON LOCAL COMMUNICATION","creators":[{"firstName":"Carels","lastName":"David","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Vandenberghe","lastName":"Wim","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Moerman","lastName":"Ingrid","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Demeester","lastName":"Piet","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["RD8CJ48G"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:31:04Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:31:04Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/45VSMAXR","attachments":[{"key":"3NYPSVZ7","version":202,"itemType":"attachment","title":"David et al. -

In emergency situations, human drivers are more likely to brake than to steer, although the optimal maneuver would, more frequently, be steering alone. This statement suggests the use of automatic steering as a promising solution to avoid accidents in the future. The objective of this paper is to provide a collision avoidance system (CAS) for autonomous vehicles, focusing on pedestrian collision avoidance. The detection component involves a stereo-vision-based pedestrian detection system that provides suitable measurements of the time to collision. The collision avoidance maneuver is performed using fuzzy controllers for the actuators that mimic human behavior and reactions, along with a high-precision Global Positioning System (GPS), which provides the information needed for the autonomous navigation. The proposed system is evaluated in two steps. First, drivers’ behavior and sensor accuracy are studied in experiments carried out by manual driving. This study will be used to deﬁne the parameters of the second step, in which automatic pedestrian collision avoidance is carried out at speeds of up to 30 km/h. The performed ﬁeld tests provided encouraging results and proved the viability of the proposed approach.","title":"Autonomous Pedestrian Collision Avoidance Using a Fuzzy Steering Controller","creators":[{"firstName":"David","lastName":"Fernandez Llorca","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Vicente","lastName":"Milanes","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ignacio","lastName":"Parra Alonso","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Miguel","lastName":"Gavilan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Iván","lastName":"Garcia Daza","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Joshué","lastName":"Perez","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Miguel Ángel","lastName":"Sotelo","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["RD8CJ48G"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:38:13Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:38:14Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/V5UW8H9X","attachments":[{"key":"L74LE6CY","version":372,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Fernandez Llorca et al. - 2011 - Autonomous Pedestrian Collision Avoidance Using a .pdf","parentItem":"V5UW8H9X","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Fernandez Llorca et al. - 2011 - Autonomous Pedestrian Collision Avoidance Using a .pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:38:12Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:38:14Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":3260,"key":"V5UW8H9X"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578766792,"version":0},"$loki":632},{"itemID":3259,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":372,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Fernandez Llorca et al. - 2011 - Autonomous Pedestrian Collision Avoidance Using a .pdf","parentItem":"V5UW8H9X","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Fernandez Llorca et al. - 2011 - Autonomous Pedestrian Collision Avoidance Using a .pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:38:12Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:38:14Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/L74LE6CY","itemID":3259,"key":"L74LE6CY"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578766794,"version":0},"$loki":633},{"itemID":3271,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":315,"itemType":"attachment","title":"1502.00164v1.pdf","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"1502.00164v1.pdf","tags":[],"collections":["WZB6BXMN"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:42:25Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:42:25Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/FUC8LNUM","itemID":3271,"key":"FUC8LNUM"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578766828,"version":0},"$loki":637},{"itemID":3279,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":179,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140366414003168","volume":"54","pages":"1-31","publicationTitle":"Computer Communications","ISSN":"01403664","date":"12/2014","DOI":"10.1016/j.comcom.2014.09.008","accessDate":"2018-12-18T22:42:29Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","language":"en","abstractNote":"The Internet of Things (IoT) is a new paradigm that combines aspects and technologies coming from different approaches. Ubiquitous computing, pervasive computing, Internet Protocol, sensing technologies, communication technologies, and embedded devices are merged together in order to form a system where the real and digital worlds meet and are continuously in symbiotic interaction. The smart object is the building block of the IoT vision. By putting intelligence into everyday objects, they are turned into smart objects able not only to collect information from the environment and interact/control the physical world, but also to be interconnected, to each other, through Internet to exchange data and information. The expected huge number of interconnected devices and the signiﬁcant amount of available data open new opportunities to create services that will bring tangible beneﬁts to the society, environment, economy and individual citizens. In this paper we present the key features and the driver technologies of IoT.

Market research has shown a signiﬁcant growth of sensor deployments over the past decade and has predicted a signiﬁcant increment of the growth rate in the future. These sensors continuously generate enormous amounts of data. However, in order to add value to raw sensor data we need to understand it. Collection, modelling, reasoning, and distribution of context in relation to sensor data plays critical role in this challenge. Context-aware computing has proven to be successful in understanding sensor data. In this paper, we survey context awareness from an IoT perspective. We present the necessary background by introducing the IoT paradigm and context-aware fundamentals at the beginning. Then we provide an in-depth analysis of context life cycle. We evaluate a subset of projects (50) which represent the majority of research and commercial solutions proposed in the ﬁeld of context-aware computing conducted over the last decade (2001-2011) based on our own taxonomy. Finally, based on our evaluation, we highlight the lessons to be learnt from the past and some possible directions for future research. The survey addresses a broad range of techniques, methods, models, functionalities, systems, applications, and middleware solutions related to context awareness and IoT. Our goal is not only to analyse, compare and consolidate past research work but also to appreciate their ﬁndings and discuss their applicability towards the IoT.","title":"Context Aware Computing for The Internet of Things: A Survey","shortTitle":"Context Aware Computing for The Internet of Things","creators":[{"firstName":"Charith","lastName":"Perera","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Arkady","lastName":"Zaslavsky","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Christen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Dimitrios","lastName":"Georgakopoulos","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Computer Science - Human-Computer Interaction","type":1},{"tag":"Computer Science - Software Engineering","type":1}],"collections":["WZB6BXMN"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:42:40Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:42:40Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/MQV93KU2","attachments":[{"key":"BTE7E8IU","version":274,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Perera et al. - 2014 - Context Aware Computing for The Internet of Things.pdf","parentItem":"MQV93KU2","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Perera et al. - 2014 - Context Aware Computing for The Internet of Things.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:42:23Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:42:40Z"}],"notes":[{"key":"SMKBUL93","version":187,"itemType":"note","parentItem":"MQV93KU2","note":"Comment: IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials Journal, 2013","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:42:40Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:42:40Z"}],"itemID":3284,"key":"MQV93KU2"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578766878,"version":0},"$loki":644},{"itemID":3268,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":274,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Perera et al. - 2014 - Context Aware Computing for The Internet of Things.pdf","parentItem":"MQV93KU2","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Perera et al. - 2014 - Context Aware Computing for The Internet of Things.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:42:23Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:42:40Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/BTE7E8IU","itemID":3268,"key":"BTE7E8IU"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578766880,"version":0},"$loki":645},{"itemID":3286,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":179,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.4038","publicationTitle":"arXiv:1310.4038 [cs]","date":"2013-10-15","extra":"00000 \narXiv: 1310.4038","accessDate":"2018-12-18T22:42:45Z","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","language":"en","abstractNote":"The Internet of Things (IoT) is part of Future Internet and will comprise many billions of Internet Connected Objects (ICO) or ‘things’ where things can sense, communicate, compute and potentially actuate as well as have intelligence, multi-modal interfaces, physical/ virtual identities and attributes. Collecting data from these objects is an important task as it allows software systems to understand the environment better. Many different hardware devices may involve in the process of collecting and uploading sensor data to the cloud where complex processing can occur. Further, we cannot expect all these objects to be connected to the computers due to technical and economical reasons. Therefore, we should be able to utilize resource constrained devices to collect data from these ICOs. On the other hand, it is critical to process the collected sensor data before sending them to the cloud to make sure the sustainability of the infrastructure due to energy constraints. This requires to move the sensor data processing tasks towards the resource constrained computational devices (e.g. mobile phones). In this paper, we propose Mobile Sensor Data Processing Engine (MOSDEN), an plug-in-based IoT middleware for mobile devices, that allows to collect and process sensor data without programming efforts. Our architecture also supports sensing as a service model. We present the results of the evaluations that demonstrate its suitability towards real world deployments.

One of the key issues enabling future solutions is achieving an effective integration between mobile apps and vehicles. Such integration can be efﬁciently achieved on all existing vehicles by relying on the On Board Diagnostic (OBD-II) interface. This allows obtaining critical information such as speed, fuel consumption, gas emissions and system failures. In this paper we propose a vehicle emulation platform, called VEWE, that allows developing and testing OBD-II aware applications. The advantages of this approach include: avoiding the need for a real vehicle, allowing to easily generate realistic vehicle parameter patterns, and supporting emulated GPS functionality. We evaluate our platform by conducting a performance analysis in terms of OBD-II response times and channel capacity when relying on a Bluetooth adapter. We compare our results with respect to those obtained in real vehicles, and demonstrate that our VEWE platform behaves similarly to realistic on board devices, thereby providing a complete and reliable platform for smartphone application development.","title":"Validation of a vehicle emulation platform supporting OBD-II communications","proceedingsTitle":"2015 12th Annual IEEE Consumer Communications and Networking Conference (CCNC)","creators":[{"firstName":"Oscar","lastName":"Alvear","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Carlos T.","lastName":"Calafate","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Juan-Carlos","lastName":"Cano","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Pietro","lastName":"Manzoni","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["T8I8GNGE"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:43:22Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:43:23Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/8N9RPZBN","attachments":[{"key":"3Y6VC32N","version":206,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Alvear et al. - 2015 - Validation of a vehicle emulation platform support.pdf","parentItem":"8N9RPZBN","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Alvear et al. - 2015 - Validation of a vehicle emulation platform support.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:43:19Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:43:23Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":3304,"key":"8N9RPZBN"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578767008,"version":0},"$loki":658},{"itemID":3299,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":206,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Alvear et al. - 2015 - Validation of a vehicle emulation platform support.pdf","parentItem":"8N9RPZBN","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Alvear et al. - 2015 - Validation of a vehicle emulation platform support.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:43:19Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:43:23Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/3Y6VC32N","itemID":3299,"key":"3Y6VC32N"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578767008,"version":0},"$loki":659},{"itemID":3306,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":179,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"http://www.journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0373463303002212","volume":"56","issue":"2","pages":"257-275","publicationTitle":"Journal of Navigation","ISSN":"03734633, 14697785","date":"5/2003","extra":"00000","DOI":"10.1017/S0373463303002212","accessDate":"2018-12-18T22:43:27Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","language":"en","title":"An Extended Kalman Filter Algorithm for Integrating GPS and Low Cost Dead Reckoning System Data for Vehicle Performance and Emissions Monitoring","creators":[{"firstName":"L.","lastName":"Zhao","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"W.

These applications can be grouped into three types, namely, road safety, traffic efficiency, and infotainment, each with its own set of functional and performance requirements. In pursuance of assisting drivers to travel safely and comfortably, several of these requirements have to be met simultaneously. While the coexistence of multiple radio access technologies brings immense opportunities towards meeting most of the vehicular networking application requirements, it is equally important and challenging to identify the strength and weaknesses of each technology and understand which technology is more suitable for the given networking scenario. In this paper, we evaluate two of the most viable communication standards, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.11p and long-term evolution (LTE) by 3rd Generation Partnership Project for vehicular networking. A detailed performance evaluation study of the standards is given for a variety of parameter settings such as beacon transmission frequency, vehicle density, and vehicle average speed. Both standards are compared in terms of delay, reliability, scalability, and mobility support in the context of various application requirements. Furthermore, through extensive simulation-based study, we validated the effectiveness of both standards to handle different application requirements and share insight for further research directions. The results indicate that IEEE 802.11p offers acceptable performance for sparse network topologies with limited mobility support. On the other hand, LTE meets most of the application requirements in terms of reliability, scalability, and mobility support; however, it is challenging to obtain stringent delay requirements in the presence of higher cellular network traffic load.","title":"LTE and IEEE 802.11p for vehicular networking: a performance evaluation","shortTitle":"LTE and IEEE 802.11p for vehicular networking","creators":[{"firstName":"Zeeshan","lastName":"Hameed Mir","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Fethi","lastName":"Filali","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["WZB6BXMN"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:43:59Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:43:59Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/WUB783CA","attachments":[{"key":"9DDUJ4AG","version":242,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Hameed Mir and Filali - 2014 - LTE and IEEE 802.11p for vehicular networking a p.pdf","parentItem":"WUB783CA","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Hameed Mir and Filali - 2014 - LTE and IEEE 802.11p for vehicular networking a p.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:43:43Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:43:59Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":3335,"key":"WUB783CA"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578767130,"version":0},"$loki":672},{"itemID":3313,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":242,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Hameed Mir and Filali - 2014 - LTE and IEEE 802.11p for vehicular networking a p.pdf","parentItem":"WUB783CA","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Hameed Mir and Filali - 2014 - LTE and IEEE 802.11p for vehicular networking a p.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:43:43Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:43:59Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/9DDUJ4AG","itemID":3313,"key":"9DDUJ4AG"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578767130,"version":0},"$loki":673},{"itemID":3337,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":179,"itemType":"conferencePaper","url":"http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2908961.2927000","place":"Denver, Colorado, USA","publisher":"ACM Press","pages":"823-839","ISBN":"978-1-4503-4323-7","date":"2016","extra":"00000","DOI":"10.1145/2908961.2927000","accessDate":"2018-12-18T22:44:02Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","conferenceName":"the 2016","language":"en","title":"Intelligent Systems for Smart Cities","proceedingsTitle":"Proceedings of the 2016 on Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference Companion - GECCO '16 Companion","creators":[{"firstName":"Enrique","lastName":"Alba","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["WZB6BXMN"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:44:02Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:44:02Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/XWL7ZQRP","attachments":[{"key":"9JTDGC6B","version":245,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Alba - 2016 - Intelligent Systems for Smart Cities.pdf","parentItem":"XWL7ZQRP","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Alba - 2016 - Intelligent Systems for Smart Cities.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:43:44Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:44:02Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":3337,"key":"XWL7ZQRP"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578767166,"version":0},"$loki":676},{"itemID":3315,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":245,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Alba - 2016 - Intelligent Systems for Smart Cities.pdf","parentItem":"XWL7ZQRP","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Alba - 2016 - Intelligent Systems for Smart Cities.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:43:44Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:44:02Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/9JTDGC6B","itemID":3315,"key":"9JTDGC6B"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578767168,"version":0},"$loki":677},{"itemID":3338,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":179,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4298901/","volume":"8","issue":"3","pages":"413-430","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","ISSN":"1524-9050","date":"09/2007","extra":"00000","DOI":"10.1109/TITS.2007.903444","accessDate":"2018-12-18T22:44:03Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","language":"en","abstractNote":"This paper describes the recent research on the enhancement of pedestrian safety to help develop a better understanding of the nature, issues, approaches, and challenges surrounding the problem.

The importance of pedestrian protection is emphasized in a global context, discussing the research programs and efforts in various countries. Pedestrian safety measures, including infrastructure enhancements and passive safety features in vehicles, are described, followed by a systematic description of active safety systems based on pedestrian detection using sensors in vehicle and infrastructure. The pedestrian detection approaches are classiﬁed according to various criteria such as the type and conﬁguration of sensors, as well as the video cues and classiﬁers used in detection algorithms. It is noted that collision avoidance not only requires detection of pedestrians but also requires collision prediction using pedestrian dynamics and behavior analysis. Hence, this paper includes research dealing with probabilistic modeling of pedestrian behavior for predicting collisions between pedestrians and vehicles.","title":"Pedestrian Protection Systems: Issues, Survey, and Challenges","shortTitle":"Pedestrian Protection Systems","creators":[{"firstName":"T.","lastName":"Gandhi","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"M.M.","lastName":"Trivedi","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["RD8CJ48G"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:44:03Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:44:03Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/P68N6FGJ","attachments":[{"key":"DXSTNJMI","version":297,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Gandhi and Trivedi - 2007 - Pedestrian Protection Systems Issues, Survey, and.pdf","parentItem":"P68N6FGJ","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Gandhi and Trivedi - 2007 - Pedestrian Protection Systems Issues, Survey, and.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:43:44Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:44:04Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":3338,"key":"P68N6FGJ"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578767180,"version":0},"$loki":678},{"itemID":3316,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":297,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Gandhi and Trivedi - 2007 - Pedestrian Protection Systems Issues, Survey, and.pdf","parentItem":"P68N6FGJ","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Gandhi and Trivedi - 2007 - Pedestrian Protection Systems Issues, Survey, and.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:43:44Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:44:04Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/DXSTNJMI","itemID":3316,"key":"DXSTNJMI"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578767180,"version":0},"$loki":679},{"itemID":3385,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":284,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Soyturk et al. - 2016 - From vehicular networks to vehicular clouds in sma.pdf","parentItem":"YYDAQYEM","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Soyturk et al. - 2016 - From vehicular networks to vehicular clouds in sma.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:46:04Z","dateModified":"2019-01-19T17:00:39Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/CTL48CKJ","itemID":3385,"key":"CTL48CKJ"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578767212,"version":0},"$loki":684},{"itemID":3348,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":180,"itemType":"conferencePaper","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5625282/","place":"Funchal, Madeira Island, Portugal","publisher":"IEEE","pages":"216-223","ISBN":"978-1-4244-7657-2","date":"09/2010","extra":"00000","DOI":"10.1109/ITSC.2010.5625282","accessDate":"2018-12-18T22:44:17Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","conferenceName":"2010 13th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems - (ITSC 2010)","language":"en","abstractNote":"Successful development of effective real-time traffic management and information systems requires high quality traffic information in real-time.

Traffic on this motorway heading to Lisbon in the morning rush hours typically experiences high levels of congestion.

In the real world, the situation is different and most continuously collected data streams are generated by dynamic processes, which may change over time, in some cases even drastically. The change in the underlying concept, also known as concept drift, causes the data-mining model generated from past examples to become less accurate and relevant for classifying the current data. Most online learning algorithms deal with concept drift by generating a new model every time a concept drift is detected. On one hand, this solution ensures accurate and relevant models at all times, thus implying an increase in the classiﬁcation accuracy. On the other hand, this approach suffers from a major drawback, which is the high computational cost of generating new models. The problem is getting worse when a concept drift is detected more frequently and, hence, a compromise in terms of computational effort and accuracy is needed. This work describes a series of incremental algorithms that are shown empirically to produce more accurate classiﬁcation models than the batch algorithms in the presence of a concept drift while being computationally cheaper than existing incremental methods. The proposed incremental algorithms are based on an advanced decision-tree learning methodology called ‘‘Info-Fuzzy Network’’ (IFN), which is capable to induce compact and accurate classiﬁcation models. The algorithms are evaluated on real-world streams of trafﬁc and intrusion-detection data.","title":"Info-fuzzy algorithms for mining dynamic data streams","creators":[{"firstName":"Lior","lastName":"Cohen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Gil","lastName":"Avrahami","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Last","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Abraham","lastName":"Kandel","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["ET67I444"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:45:29Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:45:29Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/CXAHW4NF","attachments":[{"key":"4XXG6XPW","version":211,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Cohen et al. - 2008 - Info-fuzzy algorithms for mining dynamic data stre.pdf","parentItem":"CXAHW4NF","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Cohen et al. - 2008 - Info-fuzzy algorithms for mining dynamic data stre.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:45:21Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:45:29Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":3366,"key":"CXAHW4NF"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578767312,"version":0},"$loki":697},{"itemID":3354,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":211,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Cohen et al. - 2008 - Info-fuzzy algorithms for mining dynamic data stre.pdf","parentItem":"CXAHW4NF","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Cohen et al. - 2008 - Info-fuzzy algorithms for mining dynamic data stre.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:45:21Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:45:29Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/4XXG6XPW","itemID":3354,"key":"4XXG6XPW"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578767312,"version":0},"$loki":698},{"itemID":3371,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":180,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12544-015-0170-8","volume":"7","issue":"3","publicationTitle":"European Transport Research Review","ISSN":"1867-0717, 1866-8887","date":"9/2015","extra":"00000","DOI":"10.1007/s12544-015-0170-8","accessDate":"2018-12-18T22:45:35Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","language":"en","abstractNote":"Background Accurate prediction of traffic flow is an integral component in most of the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) applications.

Over the last few years, trafﬁc data have been exploding, and we have truly entered the era of big data for transportation. Existing trafﬁc ﬂow prediction methods mainly use shallow trafﬁc prediction models and are still unsatisfying for many real-world applications. This situation inspires us to rethink the trafﬁc ﬂow prediction problem based on deep architecture models with big trafﬁc data. In this paper, a novel deep-learning-based trafﬁc ﬂow prediction method is proposed, which considers the spatial and temporal correlations inherently. A stacked autoencoder model is used to learn generic trafﬁc ﬂow features, and it is trained in a greedy layerwise fashion. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst time that a deep architecture model is applied using autoencoders as building blocks to represent trafﬁc ﬂow features for prediction. Moreover, experiments demonstrate that the proposed method for trafﬁc ﬂow prediction has superior performance.","title":"Traffic Flow Prediction With Big Data: A Deep Learning Approach","shortTitle":"Traffic Flow Prediction With Big Data","creators":[{"firstName":"Yisheng","lastName":"Lv","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yanjie","lastName":"Duan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Wenwen","lastName":"Kang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Zhengxi","lastName":"Li","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Fei-Yue","lastName":"Wang","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["WFNPCDYD"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:45:38Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:45:38Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/MG7625BD","attachments":[{"key":"826WVVBK","version":233,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Lv et al. - 2014 - Traffic Flow Prediction With Big Data A Deep Lear.pdf","parentItem":"MG7625BD","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Lv et al. - 2014 - Traffic Flow Prediction With Big Data A Deep Lear.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:45:25Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:45:38Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":3373,"key":"MG7625BD"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578767378,"version":0},"$loki":707},{"itemID":3362,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":233,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Lv et al. - 2014 - Traffic Flow Prediction With Big Data A Deep Lear.pdf","parentItem":"MG7625BD","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Lv et al. - 2014 - Traffic Flow Prediction With Big Data A Deep Lear.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:45:25Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:45:38Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/826WVVBK","itemID":3362,"key":"826WVVBK"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578767380,"version":0},"$loki":708},{"itemID":3374,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":180,"itemType":"conferencePaper","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1678242/","place":"Valencia, Spain","publisher":"IEEE","pages":"200-207","ISBN":"978-0-7803-9455-1","date":"2006","extra":"00000","DOI":"10.1109/NGI.2006.1678242","accessDate":"2018-12-18T22:45:39Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","conferenceName":"2006 2nd Conference on Next Generation Internet Design and Engineering, 2006.

Cars have no power constraints and they can be instrumented with high end computational units and graphic devices. The deployment at scale of urban vehicular systems, however, requires a careful design able to consider challenges across several domains. Vehicular systems are arguably a prominent example of cyber-physical systems. The development of such systems requires a truly multidisciplinary approach and a close integration between the application, communication, and physical domains. Hardware and software mounted on vehicles will face a harsh physical and communication environment that will greatly affect all the system components. In this paper we report on the challenges and opportunities for multimedia vehicular urban sensing systems based on our ﬁeld experiences in Macao (China) and Los Angels (USA). We designed and built the components for a pollution monitoring system able to support closed-loop optimization between pollution and trafﬁc management. Our initial set of prototype vehicles are now running in the city of Macao and they are measuring the air parameters as well as the urban trafﬁc. The paper aims at exposing some of the issues encountered, outlining the problems of a city wide deployment, and augmenting our in-ﬁeld experience with the results from large scale simulation studies.","title":"Challenges and opportunities in immersive vehicular sensing: Lessons from urban deployments","shortTitle":"Challenges and opportunities in immersive vehicular sensing","creators":[{"firstName":"Giovanni","lastName":"Pau","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Rita","lastName":"Tse","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["T8I8GNGE"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:46:10Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:46:10Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/H37PISN3","attachments":[{"key":"GILXBAN9","version":324,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Pau and Tse - 2012 - Challenges and opportunities in immersive vehicula.pdf","parentItem":"H37PISN3","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Pau and Tse - 2012 - Challenges and opportunities in immersive vehicula.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:46:02Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:46:10Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":3392,"key":"H37PISN3"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578767488,"version":0},"$loki":717},{"itemID":3378,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":324,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Pau and Tse - 2012 - Challenges and opportunities in immersive vehicula.pdf","parentItem":"H37PISN3","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Pau and Tse - 2012 - Challenges and opportunities in immersive vehicula.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:46:02Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:46:10Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/GILXBAN9","itemID":3378,"key":"GILXBAN9"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578767488,"version":0},"$loki":718},{"itemID":3394,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":180,"itemType":"conferencePaper","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6803166/","place":"Seoul, Korea (South)","publisher":"IEEE","pages":"241-246","ISBN":"978-1-4799-3459-1","date":"03/2014","extra":"00000","DOI":"10.1109/WF-IoT.2014.6803166","accessDate":"2018-12-18T22:46:12Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","conferenceName":"2014 IEEE World Forum on Internet of Things (WF-IoT)","language":"en","abstractNote":"Traditionally, the vehicle has been the extension of the man’s ambulatory system, docile to the driver’s commands.

The next step in this evolution is just around the corner: the Internet of Autonomous Vehicles. Pioneered by the Google car, the Internet of Vehicles will be a distributed transport fabric capable to make its own decisions about driving customers to their destinations. Like other important instantiations of the Internet of Things (e.g., the smart building), the Internet of Vehicles will have communications, storage, intelligence, and learning capabilities to anticipate the customers’ intentions. The concept that will help transition to the Internet of Vehicles is the Vehicular Cloud, the equivalent of Internet cloud for vehicles, providing all the services required by the autonomous vehicles.

Advanced systems to improve and automate processes within a city will play a leading role in smart cities. From smart design of buildings, which capture rain water for later use, to intelligent control systems, which can monitor infrastructures autonomously, the possible improvements enabled by sensing technologies are immense. Ubiquitous sensing poses numerous challenges, which are of a technological or social nature. This paper presents an overview of the state of the art with regards to sensing in smart cities. Topics include sensing applications in smart cities, sensing platforms and technical challenges associated with these technologies. In an effort to provide a holistic view of how sensing technologies play a role in smart cities, a range of applications and technical challenges associated with these applications are discussed. As some of these applications and technologies belong to different disciplines, the material presented in this paper attempts to bridge these to provide a broad overview, which can be of help to researchers and developers in understanding how advanced sensing can play a role in smart cities.","title":"The Role of Advanced Sensing in Smart Cities","creators":[{"firstName":"Gerhard","lastName":"Hancke","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Bruno","lastName":"Silva","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Gerhard","lastName":"Hancke, Jr.","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["WZB6BXMN"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:46:22Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:46:22Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/264F83MX","attachments":[{"key":"3XSTERPC","version":204,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Hancke et al. - 2012 - The Role of Advanced Sensing in Smart Cities.pdf","parentItem":"264F83MX","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Hancke et al. - 2012 - The Role of Advanced Sensing in Smart Cities.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:46:05Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:46:22Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":3401,"key":"264F83MX"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578767626,"version":0},"$loki":727},{"itemID":3387,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":204,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Hancke et al. - 2012 - The Role of Advanced Sensing in Smart Cities.pdf","parentItem":"264F83MX","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Hancke et al. - 2012 - The Role of Advanced Sensing in Smart Cities.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:46:05Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:46:22Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/3XSTERPC","itemID":3387,"key":"3XSTERPC"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578767628,"version":0},"$loki":728},{"itemID":3402,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":180,"itemType":"conferencePaper","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6257116/","place":"Ayia Napa, Cyprus","publisher":"IEEE","pages":"152-155","ISBN":"978-1-4673-2039-9 978-1-4673-2038-2 978-1-4673-2037-5","date":"06/2012","extra":"00000","DOI":"10.1109/MedHocNet.2012.6257116","accessDate":"2018-12-18T22:46:23Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","conferenceName":"2012 The 11th Annual Mediterranean Ad Hoc Networking Workshop (Med-Hoc-Net)","language":"en","abstractNote":"Mobile Cloud Computing is a new ﬁeld of research that aims to study mobile agents (people, vehicles, robots) as they interact and collaborate to sense the environment, process the data, propagate the results and more generally share resources.

We then focus on the Mobile Vehicular Cloud and review cloud applications ranging from urban sensing to intelligent transportation.","title":"Vehicular Cloud Computing","proceedingsTitle":"2012 The 11th Annual Mediterranean Ad Hoc Networking Workshop (Med-Hoc-Net)","creators":[{"firstName":"Mario","lastName":"Gerla","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["T8I8GNGE"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:46:23Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:46:24Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/SNSUCWAY","attachments":[{"key":"H3PGHBPZ","version":328,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Gerla - 2012 - Vehicular Cloud Computing.pdf","parentItem":"SNSUCWAY","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Gerla - 2012 - Vehicular Cloud Computing.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:46:05Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:46:24Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":3402,"key":"SNSUCWAY"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578767644,"version":0},"$loki":729},{"itemID":3388,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":328,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Gerla - 2012 - Vehicular Cloud Computing.pdf","parentItem":"SNSUCWAY","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Gerla - 2012 - Vehicular Cloud Computing.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:46:05Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:46:24Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/H3PGHBPZ","itemID":3388,"key":"H3PGHBPZ"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578767644,"version":0},"$loki":730},{"itemID":3403,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":180,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6736756/","volume":"52","issue":"2","pages":"148-155","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","ISSN":"0163-6804","date":"02/2014","extra":"00000","DOI":"10.1109/MCOM.2014.6736756","accessDate":"2018-12-18T22:46:25Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","language":"en","abstractNote":"Over the past several decades, VANET has been a core networking technology to provide safety and comfort to drivers in vehicular environments. Emerging applications and services, however, require major changes on its underlying computing and networking models, which demands new network planning for VANET. This article especially examines how VANET evolves with two emerging paradigms - Vehicular Cloud Computing and Information Centric Networking. VCC brings the mobile cloud model to vehicular networks and thus changes the way of network service provisioning, whereas ICN changes the notion of data routing and dissemination. We envision a new vehicular networking system, Vehicular Cloud Networking, on top of them. This article scrutinizes its architecture and operations and discusses its design principles.","title":"Vehicular cloud networking: architecture and design principles","shortTitle":"Vehicular cloud networking","creators":[{"firstName":"Euisin","lastName":"Lee","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Eun-Kyu","lastName":"Lee","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mario","lastName":"Gerla","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Soon","lastName":"Oh","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["T8I8GNGE"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:46:25Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:46:25Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/5T8PVYLA","attachments":[{"key":"G2Z5TDJA","version":316,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Lee et al. -

Underlying the formation of norms is the ubiquitous belief that there is a correct response for every situation and an abiding interest for persons to base their responses on these correct foundations. Given such a belief, a normative evaluation of a feeling, thought or action is likely to arise when persons perceive that their positive or negative attitudinal evaluation is shared by one or more influential others. If interpersonal agreements validate attitudes and transform attitudes into norms, then the development of a theory of norm formation may draw on extant “combinatorial” theories of consensus production that describe how shared attitudes are produced and maintained in groups. The network theory of social influence that I employ is one such combinatorial approach. An important sociological implication of this network theory is that the content of norms must be consistent with the social stratification (or more general pattern of inequality) of interpersonal influences in a group. I illustrate the theory with an analysis of Roethlisberger and Dickson’s (1939) classic observations on the Bank Wiring Observation Room.","title":"Norm formation in social influence networks","creators":[{"firstName":"Noah E.","lastName":"Friedkin","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"“Combinatorial” theories","type":1},{"tag":"Anderson’s weighted averaging model","type":1},{"tag":"Bank Wiring Observation Room","type":1}],"collections":["28M75EK7"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-20T10:58:35Z","dateModified":"2018-12-20T10:58:36Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/52IG5RAX","attachments":[{"key":"KMWGKMAD","version":367,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://ac.els-cdn.com/S0378873301000363/1-s2.0-S0378873301000363-main.pdf?_tid=05181fc4-834e-4a7f-aa34-d559c6fa37f0&acdnat=1545303693_bf34dbd36fe034b193881d004788ec3a","accessDate":"2018-12-20T10:58:39Z","title":"Friedkin_2001_Norm formation in social influence networks.pdf","parentItem":"52IG5RAX","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Friedkin_2001_Norm formation in social influence networks.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-20T10:58:39Z","dateModified":"2018-12-20T10:58:39Z"},{"key":"BNPZHC4M","version":268,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378873301000363","accessDate":"2018-12-20T10:58:38Z","title":"ScienceDirect Snapshot","parentItem":"52IG5RAX","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"S0378873301000363.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-20T10:58:38Z","dateModified":"2018-12-20T10:58:38Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":3415,"key":"52IG5RAX"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578767720,"version":0},"$loki":742},{"itemID":3417,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":367,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://ac.els-cdn.com/S0378873301000363/1-s2.0-S0378873301000363-main.pdf?_tid=05181fc4-834e-4a7f-aa34-d559c6fa37f0&acdnat=1545303693_bf34dbd36fe034b193881d004788ec3a","accessDate":"2018-12-20T10:58:39Z","title":"Friedkin_2001_Norm formation in social influence networks.pdf","parentItem":"52IG5RAX","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Friedkin_2001_Norm formation in social influence networks.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-20T10:58:39Z","dateModified":"2018-12-20T10:58:39Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/KMWGKMAD","itemID":3417,"key":"KMWGKMAD"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578767722,"version":0},"$loki":743},{"itemID":3416,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":268,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378873301000363","accessDate":"2018-12-20T10:58:38Z","title":"ScienceDirect Snapshot","parentItem":"52IG5RAX","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"S0378873301000363.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-20T10:58:38Z","dateModified":"2018-12-20T10:58:38Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/BNPZHC4M","itemID":3416,"key":"BNPZHC4M"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578767722,"version":0},"$loki":744},{"itemID":3418,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":275,"itemType":"attachment","title":"AGPSinet.pdf","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"AGPSinet.pdf","tags":[],"collections":["28M75EK7"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-20T11:00:08Z","dateModified":"2018-12-20T11:00:08Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/BZHSNIJL","itemID":3418,"key":"BZHSNIJL"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578767748,"version":0},"$loki":745},{"itemID":3420,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":181,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/cpe.3370","volume":"27","issue":"15","pages":"3915-3942","publicationTitle":"Concurrency and Computation: Practice and Experience","ISSN":"15320626","date":"10/2015","extra":"00007","DOI":"10.1002/cpe.3370","accessDate":"2019-01-13T14:58:22Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","language":"en","title":"A survey of recommendation techniques based on offline data processing: A SURVEY OF RECOMMENDATION TECHNIQUES BASED ON OFFLINE DATA PROCESSING","shortTitle":"A survey of recommendation techniques based on offline data processing","creators":[{"firstName":"Yongli","lastName":"Ren","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Li","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Wanlei","lastName":"Zhou","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["P7ZY83ZD"],"relations":{"dc:replaces":["http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/EMF9A3T5"]},"dateAdded":"2019-01-13T14:58:22Z","dateModified":"2019-01-19T17:00:41Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/DIG6R5EB","attachments":[{"key":"8EM6T4FM","version":237,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Ren et al. -

Mesh networking allows wider low cost Internet access while blockchain enables complete transparency and accountability for investments and revenue or other forms of economic compensations from sharing of network traﬃc, content and services. Crowdsourcing network coverage combined with crowdfunding costs can create sustainable yet decentralized Internet access infrastructures, where every participant can invest in resources, and pay and be paid for usage. While mesh networks and mesh routing protocols enable self-organized networks that expand organically, cryptocurrencies and smart contracts enable the economic coordination among network providers and consumers. We explore and evaluate two existing blockchain software stacks, Hyperledger Fabric (HLF) and Ethereum geth with Proof of Authority (PoA), deployed in a real citywide production mesh network, and in a centralized laboratory network. We quantify the performance, bottlenecks and identify the current limitations and opportunities for improvement to serve the needs of wireless mesh networks.","title":"Blockchain for Economically Sustainable Wireless Mesh Networks","creators":[{"firstName":"Aniruddh Rao","lastName":"Kabbinale","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Emmanouil","lastName":"Dimogerontakis","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mennan","lastName":"Selimi","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Anwaar","lastName":"Ali","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Leandro","lastName":"Navarro","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Arjuna","lastName":"Sathiaseelan","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Computer Science - Cryptography and Security","type":1},{"tag":"Computer Science - Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","type":1},{"tag":"Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture","type":1}],"collections":["LPPBWFRS"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-01-19T13:01:07Z","dateModified":"2019-01-19T13:01:08Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/TYC7IVH9","attachments":[{"key":"87P92MXE","version":234,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.04078.pdf","accessDate":"2019-01-19T13:01:04Z","title":"Kabbinale et al. - 2018 - Blockchain for Economically Sustainable Wireless M.pdf","parentItem":"TYC7IVH9","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Kabbinale et al. - 2018 - Blockchain for Economically Sustainable Wireless M.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-01-19T13:01:04Z","dateModified":"2019-01-19T13:01:08Z"}],"notes":[{"key":"7I9NQTR7","version":190,"itemType":"note","parentItem":"TYC7IVH9","note":"Comment: arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1804.00561","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-01-19T13:01:07Z","dateModified":"2019-01-19T13:01:07Z"}],"itemID":3441,"key":"TYC7IVH9"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578767854,"version":0},"$loki":759},{"itemID":3440,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":234,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.04078.pdf","accessDate":"2019-01-19T13:01:04Z","title":"Kabbinale et al. - 2018 - Blockchain for Economically Sustainable Wireless M.pdf","parentItem":"TYC7IVH9","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Kabbinale et al. - 2018 - Blockchain for Economically Sustainable Wireless M.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-01-19T13:01:04Z","dateModified":"2019-01-19T13:01:08Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/87P92MXE","itemID":3440,"key":"87P92MXE"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578767856,"version":0},"$loki":760},{"itemID":3459,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":181,"itemType":"conferencePaper","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8115793/","place":"Rome","publisher":"IEEE","pages":"1-8","ISBN":"978-1-5386-3839-2","date":"10/2017","extra":"00014","DOI":"10.1109/WiMOB.2017.8115793","accessDate":"2019-01-19T14:03:37Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","conferenceName":"2017 IEEE 13th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)","language":"en","abstractNote":"The LoRa technology has emerged as an interesting solution for low power, long range IoT applications by proposing multiple ”degrees of freedom” at the physical layer. This ﬂexibility provides either a long range at the cost of a lower data rate or higher throughput at the cost of low sensitivity, so a shorter range. In this paper, we analyze the ﬂexibility of LoRa and propose various strategies to adapt its radio parameters (such as the spreading factor, bandwidth, and transmission power) to different deployment scenarios. We compute the energy consumption of LoRa transceivers using various radio conﬁgurations in both star and mesh topologies. Our simulation results show that in a star topology, we can achieve the optimal scaling-up/down strategy of LoRa radio parameters to obtain either a high data rate or a long range while respecting low energy consumption. In mesh networks, energy consumption is optimized by exploiting various radio conﬁgurations and the network topology (e.g., the number of hops, the network density, the cell coverage). Finally, we propose a strategy to take advantage of both star and mesh topologies.","title":"Evaluating LoRa energy efficiency for adaptive networks: From star to mesh topologies","proceedingsTitle":"2017 IEEE 13th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)","shortTitle":"Evaluating LoRa energy efficiency for adaptive networks","creators":[{"firstName":"Moises Nunez","lastName":"Ochoa","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Arturo","lastName":"Guizar","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mickael","lastName":"Maman","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Andrzej","lastName":"Duda","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["7GPW9NTN"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-01-19T14:03:37Z","dateModified":"2019-01-19T14:03:37Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/HK669NWV","attachments":[{"key":"IAAQ2PAE","version":339,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Ochoa et al. -

As a result, it is diﬃcult to determine a univocal architecture to identify as a reference and several scenarios, involving different sensors, smart devices, networks or gateways, can unfold. The data exchanged within and among IoT frameworks are growing exponentially, and the pervasiveness of such systems brings them to come in possession of very sensitive information: as a consequence, Security and Privacy have become a hot topic on the IoT scenery. Furthermore, due to the great variety of technological solutions which are currently available, interoperability issues are bound to arise, especially when no standard API interface, or communication protocol, has been oﬃcially adopted.","title":"Internet of things reference architectures, security and interoperability: A survey","shortTitle":"Internet of things reference architectures, security and interoperability","creators":[{"firstName":"B.","lastName":"Di Martino","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"M.","lastName":"Rak","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"M.","lastName":"Ficco","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"A.","lastName":"Esposito","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"S.A.","lastName":"Maisto","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"S.","lastName":"Nacchia","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["TFCFA8KG"],"relations":{"dc:replaces":["http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/GRYWTV2Z"]},"dateAdded":"2019-01-28T13:59:46Z","dateModified":"2019-01-30T16:33:19Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/IRVGXIK6","attachments":[{"key":"DIBFYNFA","version":291,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Di Martino et al. - 2018 - Internet of things reference architectures, securi.pdf","parentItem":"IRVGXIK6","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Di Martino et al. - 2018 - Internet of things reference architectures, securi.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-01-28T13:59:44Z","dateModified":"2019-01-28T13:59:47Z"},{"key":"JK4GNFRL","version":356,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Di Martino et al. - 2018 - Internet of things reference architectures, securi.pdf","parentItem":"IRVGXIK6","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Di Martino et al. - 2018 - Internet of things reference architectures, securi.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-01-30T16:32:32Z","dateModified":"2019-01-30T16:33:19Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":3495,"key":"IRVGXIK6"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578768270,"version":0},"$loki":801},{"itemID":3494,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":291,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Di Martino et al. - 2018 - Internet of things reference architectures, securi.pdf","parentItem":"IRVGXIK6","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Di Martino et al. - 2018 - Internet of things reference architectures, securi.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-01-28T13:59:44Z","dateModified":"2019-01-28T13:59:47Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/DIBFYNFA","itemID":3494,"key":"DIBFYNFA"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578768270,"version":0},"$loki":802},{"itemID":3505,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":356,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Di Martino et al. - 2018 - Internet of things reference architectures, securi.pdf","parentItem":"IRVGXIK6","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Di Martino et al. - 2018 - Internet of things reference architectures, securi.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-01-30T16:32:32Z","dateModified":"2019-01-30T16:33:19Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/JK4GNFRL","itemID":3505,"key":"JK4GNFRL"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578768270,"version":0},"$loki":803},{"itemID":3496,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":182,"itemType":"conferencePaper","pages":"85-88","date":"March 2014","extra":"00013","DOI":"10.1109/WF-IoT.2014.6803125","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","conferenceName":"2014 IEEE World Forum on Internet of Things (WF-IoT)","abstractNote":"This paper focuses on how technologies contributes to improving interoperability between IoT devices, and making easily use of IoT devices.
