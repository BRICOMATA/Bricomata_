In this work, we aim to find out if text contains private content by using our novel learning based approach ‚Äòprivacy detective' that combines topic modeling, named entity recognition, privacy ontology, sentiment analysis, and text normalization to represent privacy features. Privacy detective investigates a broader range of privacy concerns compared to previous approaches that focus on keyword searching or profile related properties. We collected 500,000 tweets from 100,000 Twitter users along with other information such as tweet linkages and follower relationships. We reach 95.45\\% accuracy in a two-class task classifying Twitter users who do not reveal much private information and Twitter users who share sensitive information. We score timelines according to three privacy levels after having Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) workers annotate collected tweets according to privacy categories. Supervised machine learning classification results on these annotations reach 69.63\\% accuracy on a three-class task. Inter-annotator agreement on timeline privacy scores between various AMT workers and our classifiers fall under the same positive agreement level. Additionally, we show that a user's privacy level is correlated with her friends' privacy scores and also with the privacy scores of people mentioned in her text but not with the number of her followers. As such, privacy in social networks appear to be socially constructed, which can have great implications for privacy enhancing technologies and educational interventions.},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 13th {{Workshop}} on {{Privacy}} in the {{Electronic Society}}},\n  series = {{{WPES}} '14},\n  publisher = {{ACM}},\n  urldate = {2018-02-17},\n  date = {2014},\n  pages = {35--46},\n  author = {Caliskan Islam, Aylin and Walsh, Jonathan and Greenstadt, Rachel},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Latex/res/storage/DVMCP3S2/Caliskan Islam et al. -

Combined, it could provide a more accurate representation of the social world, and it could enable a whole new set of socially-aware applications. We introduce Prometheus, a peer-to-peer service that collects and manages social information from multiple sources and implements a set of social inference functions while enforcing user-defined access control policies. Prometheus is socially-aware: it allows users to select peers that manage their social information based on social trust and exploits naturally-formed social groups for improved performance. We tested our Prometheus prototype on PlanetLab and built a mobile social application to test the performance of its social inference functions under realtime constraints. We showed that the social-based mapping of users onto peers improves the service response time and high service availability is achieved with low overhead.},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the {{ACM}}/{{IFIP}}/{{USENIX}} 11th {{International Conference}} on {{Middleware}}},\n  series = {Middleware '10},\n  publisher = {{Springer-Verlag}},\n  urldate = {2018-03-06},\n  date = {2010},\n  pages = {212--231},\n  author = {Kourtellis, Nicolas and Finnis, Joshua and Anderson, Paul and Blackburn, Jeremy and Borcea, Cristian and Iamnitchi, Adriana},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Latex/res/storage/7C4FJNYW/Kourtellis et al. - 2010 - Prometheus User-controlled P2P Social Data Manage.pdf},\n  note = {00070}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578763406,"version":0},"$loki":104},{"itemID":816,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{li_soap_2011,\n  title = {Soap: {{A}} Social Network Aided Personalized and Effective Spam Filter to Clean Your e-Mail Box},\n  shorttitle = {Soap},\n  booktitle = {{{INFOCOM}}, 2011 {{Proceedings IEEE}}},\n  publisher = {{IEEE}},\n  date = {2011},\n  pages = {1835--1843},\n  author = {Li, Ze and Shen, Haiying},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Latex/res/storage/7HB2SQGR/Li and Shen - 2011 - Soap A social network aided personalized and effe.pdf},\n  note = {00054}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578763446,"version":0},"$loki":106},{"itemID":824,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{li_leveraging_2013,\n  title = {Leveraging {{Social Networks}} to {{Combat Collusion}} in {{Reputation Systems}} for {{Peer}}-to-{{Peer Networks}}},\n  volume = {62},\n  issn = {0018-9340},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6226368/},\n  doi = {10.1109/TC.2012.158},\n  number = {9},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Transactions on Computers},\n  shortjournal = {IEEE Trans.

The steep rise in the amount of unsolicited emails, i.e. spam, in the past decade, however, has permanently disrupted this tranquility of largely steady email volume and turned mail server performance into an increasingly important issue. In this paper, we point out that modern mail servers were not originally designed with email spam in mind, and as such, as the \"common case'' workload for mail servers has shifted from legitimate emails to spam emails, we argue it is time to revisit mail server architecture design in following the system design principle of optimizing the common case. In particular, we show how to optimize the performance of three major components of modern mail servers, the concurrency architecture, the disk I/O, and DNSBL lookups, by exploiting the new \"common case\" workload. An evaluation of our prototype implementation of the enhanced postfix architecture shows that the optimizations significantly reduce the CPU, disk, and network resource consumptions, and improves the throughput of the mail server by 18\\% under a university departmental mail server workload and by 40\\% under a spam sinkhole workload.},\n  eventtitle = {2009 29th {{IEEE International Conference}} on {{Distributed Computing Systems}}},\n  booktitle = {2009 29th {{IEEE International Conference}} on {{Distributed Computing Systems}}},\n  date = {2009-06},\n  pages = {155-164},\n  author = {Pathak, A. and Jafri, S.

Many web spam demotion algorithms have been developed to combat spam via the use of the web link structure, from which the goodness or badness score of each web page is evaluated. Those scores are then used to identify spam pages or punish their rankings in search engine results. However, most of the published spam demotion algorithms differ from their base models by only very limited improvements and still suffer from some common score manipulation methods. The lack of a general framework for this field makes the task of designing high-performance spam demotion algorithms very inefficient. In this paper, we propose a unified score propagation model for web spam demotion algorithms by abstracting the score propagation process of relevant models with a forward score propagation function and a backward score propagation function, each of which can further be expressed as three sub-functions: a splitting function, an accepting function and a combination function. On the basis of the proposed model, we develop two new web spam demotion algorithms named Supervised Forward and Backward score Ranking (SFBR) and Unsupervised Forward and Backward score Ranking (UFBR). Our experiments, conducted on three large-scale public datasets, show that (1) SFBR is very robust and apparently outperforms other algorithms and (2) UFBR can obtain results comparable to some well-known supervised algorithms in the spam demotion task even if the UFBR is unsupervised.},\n  number = {6},\n  journaltitle = {Information Retrieval Journal},\n  shortjournal = {Inf Retrieval J},\n  urldate = {2018-03-07},\n  date = {2017-12-01},\n  pages = {547-574},\n  author = {Zhuang, Xu and Zhu, Yan and Chang, Chin-Chen and Peng, Qiang and Khurshid, Faisal},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Latex/res/storage/6YBDFJRH/Zhuang et al_2017_A unified score propagation model for web spam demotion algorithm.pdf},\n  note = {00001}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578763580,"version":0},"$loki":112},{"itemID":1208,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{gandouz_protect_2012,\n  title = {{{PROTECT}}\\_{{U}}: {{Un}} Systeme Communautaire Pour La Protection Des Usagers de {{Facebook}}},\n  abstract = {We introduce Protect\\_U (H\\'elou, Gandouz et al. 2012), a privacy protection system for Facebook users.

One of the fundamental difficulties is quantifying the amount of information revealed unintentionally. We present PrivAware, a tool to detect and report unintended information loss in online social networks. Our goal is to provide a rudimentary framework to identify privacy risk and provide solutions to reduce information loss. The first instance of the software is focused on information loss attributed to social circles. In subsequent releases we intend to incorporate additional capabilities to capture ancillary threat models. From our initial results, we quantify the privacy risk attributed to friend relationships in Facebook. We show that for each user in our study a majority of their personal attributes can be derived from social contacts. Moreover, we present results denoting the number of friends contributing to a correctly inferred attribute. We also provide similar results for different demographics of users. The intent of PrivAware is to not only report information loss but to recommend user actions to mitigate privacy risk. The actions provide users with the steps necessary to improve their overall privacy measurement. One obvious, but not ideal, solution is to remove risky friends. Another approach is to group risky friends and apply access controls to the group to limit visibility. In summary, our goal is to provide a unique tool to quantify information loss and provide features to reduce privacy risk.},\n  date = {2009},\n  pages = {8},\n  author = {Becker, Justin and Chen, Hao},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Latex/res/storage/GESQM5C9/Becker - 2009 - Measuring privacy risk in online social networks.pdf},\n  note = {00119}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578763608,"version":0},"$loki":114},{"itemID":1265,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{costante_privacyaware_2013,\n  title = {Privacy-{{Aware Web Service Composition}} and {{Ranking}}},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICWS.2013.27},\n  abstract = {Service selection is a key issue in the Future Internet, where applications are built by composing services and content offered by different service providers.

First, we study first-order properties of network-level features that may help distinguish spammers from legitimate senders. We examine features that can be ascertained without ever looking at a packet's contents, such as the distance in IP space to other email senders or the geographic distance between sender and receiver. We derive features that are lightweight, since they do not require seeing a large amount of email from a single IP address and can be gleaned without looking at an email's contents\\textemdash{}many such features are apparent from even a single packet. Second, we incorporate these features into a classification algorithm and evaluate the classifier's ability to automatically classify email senders as spammers or legitimate senders. We build an automated reputation engine, SNARE, based on these features using labeled data from a deployed commercial spam-filtering system. We demonstrate that SNARE can achieve comparable accuracy to existing static IP blacklists: about a 70\\% detection rate for less than a 0.3\\% false positive rate.

A way to eliminate the privacy risks is to make the privacy-sensitive data inaccessible by means of encryption. While the private data is inaccessible to any outsiders and the server, the same functionality of the system can be achieved by processing the encrypted data. Unfortunately, the efficiency of processing encrypted data constitutes a big challenge. In this paper, we present a privacy-enhanced recommender system in a social trust network, which is designed to be highly efficient. The cryptographic protocol for generating recommendations is based on homomorphic encryption and secure multi-party computation techniques. The additional overhead with regard to computation and communication is minimized by packing data. The experimental results show that our proposal is promising to be deployed in real world.},\n  eventtitle = {2011 {{International Conference}} on {{Computational Aspects}} of {{Social Networks}} ({{CASoN}})},\n  booktitle = {2011 {{International Conference}} on {{Computational Aspects}} of {{Social Networks}} ({{CASoN}})},\n  date = {2011-10},\n  pages = {82-87},\n  keywords = {data privacy,e-commerce,electronic commerce,Encryption,homomorphic encryption,Internet,Polynomials,privacy,Privacy,privacy sensitive data,private recommendations,Protocols,recommender systems,Recommender systems,secure multi-party computation,Social network services,social networking (online),social networks,social trust network,Social trust networks},\n  author = {Erkin, Z. and Veugen, T. and Lagendijk, R.

The advent of HTTPS was supposed to make profiling harder for anyone beyond the communicating end-points. In this paper we examine to what extent the above is true. We first show that by knowing the domain that a user visits, either through the Server Name Indication of the TLS protocol or through DNS, an eavesdropper can already derive basic profiling information, especially for domains whose content is homogeneous. For domains carrying a variety of categories that depend on the particular page that a user visits, e.g., news portals, e-commerce sites, etc., the basic profiling technique fails. Still, accurate profiling remains possible through transport layer fingerprinting that uses network traffic signatures to infer the exact page that a user is browsing, even under HTTPS. We demonstrate that transport fingerprinting remains robust and scalable despite hurdles such as caching, dynamic content for different device types etc.Overall our results indicate that although HTTPS makes profiling more difficult, it does not eradicate it by any means.},\n  publisher = {{ACM Press}},\n  urldate = {2018-05-23},\n  date = {2016},\n  pages = {373-379},\n  author = {Gonzalez, Roberto and Soriente, Claudio and Laoutaris, Nikolaos},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Latex/res/storage/KDWZMBUE/Gonzalez et al. - 2016 - User Profiling in the Time of HTTPS.pdf},\n  note = {00007}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578763918,"version":0},"$loki":131},{"itemID":1876,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{ramachandran_can_2006,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Can {{DNS}}-{{Based Blacklists Keep Up}} with {{Bots}}?},\n  date = {2006},\n  pages = {2},\n  author = {Ramachandran, Anirudh and Dagon, David and Feamster, Nick},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Latex/res/storage/IYGPMY4U/Ramachandran et al. - Can DNS-Based Blacklists Keep Up with Bots.pdf},\n  note = {00121}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578763948,"version":0},"$loki":133},{"itemID":1886,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{gundecha_exploiting_2011,\n  location = {{New York, NY, USA}},\n  title = {Exploiting {{Vulnerability}} to {{Secure User Privacy}} on a {{Social Networking Site}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-4503-0813-7},\n  url = {http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2020408.2020489},\n  doi = {10.1145/2020408.2020489},\n  abstract = {As (one's) social network expands, a user's privacy protection goes beyond his privacy settings and becomes a social networking problem.

With the diversity of one's social media friends, how can one figure out an effective approach to balance between vulnerability and privacy? We present a novel way to define a vulnerable friend from an individual user's perspective is dependent on whether or not the user's friends' privacy settings protect the friend and the individual's network of friends (which includes the user). As a single vulnerable friend in a user's social network might place all friends at risk, we resort to experiments and observe how much security an individual user can improve by unfriending a vulnerable friend. We also show how privacy weakens if newly accepted friends are unguarded or unprotected. This work provides a large-scale evaluation of new security and privacy indexes using a Facebook dataset. We present and discuss a new perspective for reasoning about social networking security. When a user accepts a new friend, the user should ensure that the new friend is not an increased security risk with the potential of negatively impacting the entire friend network. Additionally, by leveraging the indexes proposed and employing new strategies for unfriending vulnerable friends, it is possible to further improve security and privacy without changing the social networking site's existing architecture.},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 17th {{ACM SIGKDD International Conference}} on {{Knowledge Discovery}} and {{Data Mining}}},\n  series = {{{KDD}} '11},\n  publisher = {{ACM}},\n  urldate = {2018-05-24},\n  date = {2011},\n  pages = {511--519},\n  keywords = {privacy,social network,vulnerability},\n  author = {Gundecha, Pritam and Barbier, Geoffrey and Liu, Huan},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Latex/res/storage/7MGY7XVZ/Gundecha et al_2011_Exploiting Vulnerability to Secure User Privacy on a Social Networking Site.pdf},\n  note = {00065}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578763978,"version":0},"$loki":134},{"itemID":1890,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{cho_privacy_2016,\n  title = {Privacy and {{Social Capital}} in {{Online Social Networks}}},\n  doi = {10.1109/GLOCOM.2016.7842168},\n  abstract = {In online social networks (OSNs), individual users have a strong desire to expand their social networks through OSN activities and try to maximize the benefits from the social relationships, called social capital.

In this work, we study how individual users can expand their social networks by making trustworthy friends while not leaking their private information out to unauthorized parties or social attackers. We adopt the concepts of trust and reputation in order to preserve users' privacy while enhancing their social capital in OSNs. Given a social network topology from the Facebook, we model an individual user's interactions with other users based on feeding (e.g., posting information) and feedback behaviors (e.g., providing likes or comments). Our results show that there exists a tradeoff between social capital and privacy preservation.

In this case, if there is access to the network structure, the results show that global metrics such as closeness have a high degree of correlation with PRS. Otherwise, local and social centrality metrics based on ego-networks provide a suitable approximation to PRS. The results in real social networks confirm that local and social centrality metrics based on degree perform well in estimating the privacy risk of users.},\n  journaltitle = {Future Generation Computer Systems},\n  shortjournal = {Future Generation Computer Systems},\n  urldate = {2018-06-11},\n  date = {2018-05-01},\n  pages = {63-76},\n  keywords = {Information sharing,Privacy,Social networks},\n  author = {Alemany, J. and family=Val, given=E., prefix=del, useprefix=true and Alberola, J. and Garc\\'ia-Fornes, A.},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Latex/res/storage/BZJ38VUD/Alemany et al_2018_Estimation of privacy risk through centrality metrics.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578764414,"version":0},"$loki":159},{"itemID":2017,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{sun_trust_2006,\n  title = {A Trust Evaluation Framework in Distributed Networks: {{Vulnerability}} Analysis and Defense against Attacks},\n  doi = {10.1109/INFOCOM.2006.154},\n  shorttitle = {A Trust Evaluation Framework in Distributed Networks},\n  abstract = {The performance of distributed networks depends on collaboration among distributed entities.

Although much effort has been made to develop quantitative techniques to obtain trust value, there is a lack of coherent classification of such techniques to achieve a macro vision of trust prediction models and identify their strengths and weaknesses. In this paper, we proposed TP-TA, an analytical framework which consists of three main components: First, classification of various existing trust prediction models in terms of trust aspects in the context of OSNs. Besides, main ideas, prospects, and challenges of each approach are highlighted for further research in this field. Second, defining general criteria to analyze our proposed classification. Finally, we illustrate a qualitative comparison between each approach which is a guide to understanding their superiority to one another. This framework could lead to an efficient selection of trust prediction techniques based on the nature of the target OSN and the intended trust type.},\n  journaltitle = {Artificial Intelligence Review},\n  shortjournal = {Artif.

Social or trust network among users provides an additional information along with the ratings for improving the user reliability on the recommendation. However, in real world, trust data is sparse in nature. So, many algorithms are built for inferring trust. In this paper, we propose a new trust inference method based on the implicit influence information available in the existing trust network. This approach uses the transitivity property of the trust for trust propagation and scale-free complex network property to limit the propagation length in the network. In this regard, we define a new terminology, degree of trustworthiness for a user, which adds the global influence in the inferred trust. This process improves the recommendation accuracy from the existing trustbased recommendation and neighborhood based collaborative filtering. Due to the availability of users preference from trust network which is absent in rating data, it also alleviates the very well-known cold start users problem of a recommender system.

The proposed method involves four rating prediction mechanisms: FM use the recommendation given by the most reliable recommender with the shortest trust propagation distance from the active user as the predicted rating, FMW weights the recommendation in FM, FA uses the mean value of recommendations with the shortest trust propagation distance from the active user as the predicted rating, and FAW weights recommendations in FA.

However, few attempts have been made on reasoning about differential privacy at a system level. In this paper, we propose a formal framework to verify differential privacy in probabilistic systems. With a metric on the states of a system, we formalize differential privacy by the ratio of the probabilities in the distributions after the same labeled transitions of relevant states. We explain how traditional differential privacy can be embedded in our framework and raise an infimum metric, the least distance between two states, while not violating differential privacy. It is proven that the infimum metric is also a metric instance of differential privacy itself. Furthermore, we propose a two-level logic, a privacy variant of the familiar Hennessy\\textendash{}Milner logic, to characterize differential privacy in our framework.

As a result, redundant new metrics are proposed frequently, and privacy studies are often incomparable. In this survey we alleviate these problems by structuring the landscape of privacy metrics. For this we explain and discuss a selection of over eighty privacy metrics and introduce a categorization based on the aspect of privacy they measure, their required inputs, and the type of data that needs protection. In addition, we present a method on how to choose privacy metrics based on eight questions that help identify the right privacy metrics for a given scenario, and highlight topics where additional work on privacy metrics is needed.

Particularly, we look at the association between network composition, expectancy violations, interpersonal privacy practices and having a friends-only profile. We find that expectancy violations by weak ties and increased levels of interpersonal privacy management are positively associated with having a friends-only profile.

For some sectors, like industry, smart grids, transportation and medical services, the significance of such attacks is obvious, since IoT technologies are part of critical back-end systems. However, in sectors where IoT is usually at the end-user side, like smart homes, such attacks can be underestimated, since not all possible attack paths are examined.

Providing relevant information to the users to cater to their needs is the primary goal of website owners. Therefore, finding the content of the Web and retrieving the users' interests and needs from their behavior have become increasingly important. Web mining is used to categorize users and pages by analyzing the users' behavior, the content of the pages, and the order of the URLs that tend to be accessed in order. Web structure mining plays an important role in this approach. Two page ranking algorithms, HITS and PageRank, are commonly used in web structure mining. Both algorithms treat all links equally when distributing rank scores. Several algorithms have been developed to improve the performance of these methods. The Weighted PageRank algorithm (WPR), an extension to the standard PageRank algorithm, is introduced in this paper. WPR takes into account the importance of both the inlinks and the outlinks of the pages and distributes rank scores based on the popularity of the pages. The results of our simulation studies show that WPR performs better than the conventional PageRank algorithm in terms of returning larger number of relevant pages to a given query.},\n  eventtitle = {Proceedings. {{Second Annual Conference}} on {{Communication Networks}} and {{Services Research}}, 2004.},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings. {{Second Annual Conference}} on {{Communication Networks}} and {{Services Research}}, 2004.},\n  publisher = {{IEEE}},\n  urldate = {2018-11-19},\n  date = {2004},\n  pages = {305-314},\n  author = {Xing, W. and Ghorbani, A.},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Latex/res/storage/6Z3HFZHW/Xing and Ghorbani - 2004 - Weighted PageRank algorithm.pdf},\n  note = {00531}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578765548,"version":0},"$loki":222},{"itemID":3107,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{zhang_contact_2017,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Contact Process with Exogenous Infection and the Scaled {{SIS}} Process},\n  issn = {2051-1310, 2051-1329},\n  url = {http://fdslive.oup.com/www.oup.com/pdf/production_in_progress.pdf},\n  doi = {10.1093/comnet/cnx003},\n  abstract = {Propagation of contagion in networks depends on the graph topology. This article is concerned with studying the time-asymptotic behaviour of the extended contact processes on static, undirected, finite-size networks. This is a contact process with nonzero exogenous infection rate (also known as the -susceptible-infectedsusceptible model). The only known analytical characterization of the equilibrium distribution of this process is for complete networks. For large networks with arbitrary topology, it is infeasible to numerically solve for the equilibrium distribution since it requires solving the eigenvalue-eigenvector problem of a matrix that is exponential in N, the size of the network. We derive a condition on the infection rates under which, depending on the degree distribution of the network, the equilibrium distribution of extended contact processes on arbitrary, finite-size networks is well approximated by a closed-form formulation. We confirm the goodness of the approximation with small networks answering inference questions like the distribution of the percentage of infected individuals and the most-probable equilibrium configuration. We then use the approximation to analyse the equilibrium distribution of the extended contact process on the 4941-node US Western power grid.},\n  journaltitle = {Journal of Complex Networks},\n  shortjournal = {J.

There are two limiting cases widely analyzed in the physics literature, the so-called contact process (CP) where the contagion is expanded at a certain rate from an infected vertex to one neighbor at a time, and the reactive process (RP) in which an infected individual effectively contacts all its neighbors to expand the epidemics. However, a more realistic scenario is obtained from the interpolation between these two cases, considering a certain number of stochastic contacts per unit time. Here we propose a discrete-time formulation of the problem of contact-based epidemic spreading. We resolve a family of models, parameterized by the number of stochastic contact trials per unit time, that range from the CP to the RP. In contrast to the common heterogeneous mean-field approach, we focus on the probability of infection of individual nodes. Using this formulation, we can construct the whole phase diagram of the different infection models and determine their critical properties.},\n  number = {3},\n  journaltitle = {EPL (Europhysics Letters)},\n  shortjournal = {EPL Europhys.

The advantage of the proposed approach is the clear presentation of the behaviors of traffic lights in terms of the conditions and events that cause phase alternations. Moreover, the size of the urban traffic network control system can be easily extended with our proposed modular technique. An analysis of the control models is performed via a reachability graph method to demonstrate how the models enforce the transitions of the traffic lights.},\n  number = {2},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems},\n  shortjournal = {IEEE Trans.

Consumer products, durable goods, cars and trucks, industrial and utility components, sensors, and other everyday objects are being combined with Internet connectivity and powerful data analytic capabilities that promise to transform the way we work, live, and play. Projections for the impact of IoT on the Internet and economy are impressive, with some anticipating as many as 100 billion connected IoT devices and a global economic impact of more than \\$11 trillion by 2025. At the same time, however, the Internet of Things raises significant challenges that could stand in the way of realizing its potential benefits. Attention-grabbing headlines about the hacking of Internet-connected devices, surveillance concerns, and privacy fears already have captured public attention. Technical challenges remain and new policy, legal and development challenges are emerging. This overview document is designed to help the Internet Society community navigate the dialogue surrounding the Internet of Things in light of the competing predictions about its promises and perils. The Internet of Things engages a broad set of ideas that are complex and intertwined from different perspectives. Key concepts that serve as a foundation for exploring the opportunities and challenges of IoT include: \\textbullet{} IoT Definitions: The term Internet of Things generally refers to scenarios where network connectivity and computing capability extends to objects, sensors and everyday items not normally considered computers, allowing these devices to generate, exchange and consume data with minimal human intervention. There is, however, no single, universal definition. \\textbullet{} Enabling Technologies: The concept of combining computers, sensors, and networks to monitor and control devices has existed for decades. The recent confluence of several technology market trends, however, is bringing the Internet of Things closer to widespread reality. These include Ubiquitous Connectivity, Widespread Adoption of IP-based Networking, Computing Economics, Miniaturization, Advances in Data Analytics, and the Rise of Cloud Computing. \\textbullet{} Connectivity Models: IoT implementations use different technical communications models, each with its own characteristics. Four common communications models described by the Internet Architecture Board include: Device-to-Device, Device-to-Cloud, Device-to-Gateway, and Back-End Data-Sharing. These models highlight the flexibility in the ways that IoT devices can connect and provide value to the user. \\textbullet{} Transformational Potential: If the projections and trends towards IoT become reality, it may force a shift in thinking about the implications and issues in a world where the most common interaction with the \\ldots{}},\n  date = {2015},\n  keywords = {benefit,Cloud computing,Computer,Computers,Confluence,Greater Than,Internet Architecture Board,Internet of things,Physical object,Projections and Predictions,sensor (device),Technical standard},\n  author = {Rose, Karen and Eldridge, Scott D. and Chapin, Lyman},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Latex/res/storage/A8BN2V3I/Rose et al_2015_THE INTERNET OF THINGS.pdf},\n  note = {00006}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578765962,"version":0},"$loki":239},{"itemID":3163,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{baldi_fractional_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Fractional {{Lambda Switching}}\\texttrademark{}},\n  abstract = {Fractional Lambda ($\\lambda$) Switching (F$\\lambda$S\\texttrademark{}) adds the necessary efficiency to Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) while preserving the simplicity of whole $\\lambda$ switching.

This difficulty stems from the fact that packet scheduling decisions at each hop influences and are influenced by decisions on other hops and only a few provably efficient online scheduling algorithms exist in the multihop setting. We consider a general multihop wired network topology in which packets with various deadlines and weights arrive at and are destined to different nodes through given routes. We study the problem of joint admission control and packet scheduling in order to maximize the cumulative weights of the packets that reach their destinations within their deadlines. We first focus on uplink transmissions in the tree topology and show that the well known earliest deadline first algorithm achieves the same performance as the optimal off-line algorithm for any feasible arrival pattern. We then address the general topology with multiple source-destination pairs, develop a simple online algorithm and show that it is O(PM log PM )competitive where PM is the maximum route length among all packets. Our algorithm only requires information along the route of each packet and our result is valid for general arrival samples. Via numerical results, we show that our algorithm achieves performance that is comparable to the non-causal optimal offline algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm with a provable (based on a sample-path construction) competitive ratio, subject to hard deadline constraints for general network topologies.},\n  pages = {9},\n  author = {Mao, Zhoujia and Koksal, C Emre and Shroff, Ness B},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Latex/res/storage/54CHPJVR/Mao et al. - Online Packet Scheduling with Hard Deadlines in Wi.pdf},\n  note = {00001}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578766032,"version":0},"$loki":244},{"itemID":3168,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{tohme_evolutionary_1999,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Tokyo, Japan}},\n  title = {Evolutionary {{Petri}} Net Approach to Periodic Job-Shop-Scheduling},\n  volume = {4},\n  isbn = {978-0-7803-5731-0},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/812444/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICSMC.1999.812444},\n  abstract = {In this paper, Periodic Job-Shop-Scheduling Problem (PJSSP) extended from Job-Shop-Scheduling Problem (JSSP) is considered.

While it is obvious that any instrument for the measurement of time operates according to a discrete time scale, due to its finite precision, and that most interesting modern systems, being digital in nature, intrinsicallyuse a discrete time scale, models often use a continuous time scale. The reason for this discrepancy lies in the greater simplicity of continuous time models. Indeed, if the time axis is discrete, the model has to consider the fact that multiple events may occur between two consecutive time marks, and explore the effect of all possible combinations among these events. In the continuous time scale, instead, using appropriate probabilistic assumptions, it is possible to univocally order events, so that it is always possible to take into consideration only one event at a time.},\n  booktitle = {Advances in {{Petri Nets}} 1989},\n  publisher = {{Springer Berlin Heidelberg}},\n  urldate = {2018-12-18},\n  date = {1990},\n  pages = {1-29},\n  author = {Marsan, M.

In emergency situations, human drivers are more likely to brake than to steer, although the optimal maneuver would, more frequently, be steering alone. This statement suggests the use of automatic steering as a promising solution to avoid accidents in the future. The objective of this paper is to provide a collision avoidance system (CAS) for autonomous vehicles, focusing on pedestrian collision avoidance. The detection component involves a stereo-vision-based pedestrian detection system that provides suitable measurements of the time to collision. The collision avoidance maneuver is performed using fuzzy controllers for the actuators that mimic human behavior and reactions, along with a high-precision Global Positioning System (GPS), which provides the information needed for the autonomous navigation. The proposed system is evaluated in two steps. First, drivers' behavior and sensor accuracy are studied in experiments carried out by manual driving. This study will be used to define the parameters of the second step, in which automatic pedestrian collision avoidance is carried out at speeds of up to 30 km/h. The performed field tests provided encouraging results and proved the viability of the proposed approach.},\n  number = {2},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems},\n  shortjournal = {IEEE Trans.

Collection, modelling, reasoning, and distribution of context in relation to sensor data plays critical role in this challenge. Context-aware computing has proven to be successful in understanding sensor data. In this paper, we survey context awareness from an IoT perspective. We present the necessary background by introducing the IoT paradigm and context-aware fundamentals at the beginning. Then we provide an in-depth analysis of context life cycle. We evaluate a subset of projects (50) which represent the majority of research and commercial solutions proposed in the field of context-aware computing conducted over the last decade (2001-2011) based on our own taxonomy. Finally, based on our evaluation, we highlight the lessons to be learnt from the past and some possible directions for future research. The survey addresses a broad range of techniques, methods, models, functionalities, systems, applications, and middleware solutions related to context awareness and IoT.

These applications can be grouped into three types, namely, road safety, traffic efficiency, and infotainment, each with its own set of functional and performance requirements. In pursuance of assisting drivers to travel safely and comfortably, several of these requirements have to be met simultaneously. While the coexistence of multiple radio access technologies brings immense opportunities towards meeting most of the vehicular networking application requirements, it is equally important and challenging to identify the strength and weaknesses of each technology and understand which technology is more suitable for the given networking scenario. In this paper, we evaluate two of the most viable communication standards, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.11p and long-term evolution (LTE) by 3rd Generation Partnership Project for vehicular networking. A detailed performance evaluation study of the standards is given for a variety of parameter settings such as beacon transmission frequency, vehicle density, and vehicle average speed. Both standards are compared in terms of delay, reliability, scalability, and mobility support in the context of various application requirements. Furthermore, through extensive simulation-based study, we validated the effectiveness of both standards to handle different application requirements and share insight for further research directions. The results indicate that IEEE 802.11p offers acceptable performance for sparse network topologies with limited mobility support.

Pedestrian safety measures, including infrastructure enhancements and passive safety features in vehicles, are described, followed by a systematic description of active safety systems based on pedestrian detection using sensors in vehicle and infrastructure. The pedestrian detection approaches are classified according to various criteria such as the type and configuration of sensors, as well as the video cues and classifiers used in detection algorithms. It is noted that collision avoidance not only requires detection of pedestrians but also requires collision prediction using pedestrian dynamics and behavior analysis.

In the real world, the situation is different and most continuously collected data streams are generated by dynamic processes, which may change over time, in some cases even drastically. The change in the underlying concept, also known as concept drift, causes the data-mining model generated from past examples to become less accurate and relevant for classifying the current data. Most online learning algorithms deal with concept drift by generating a new model every time a concept drift is detected. On one hand, this solution ensures accurate and relevant models at all times, thus implying an increase in the classification accuracy. On the other hand, this approach suffers from a major drawback, which is the high computational cost of generating new models. The problem is getting worse when a concept drift is detected more frequently and, hence, a compromise in terms of computational effort and accuracy is needed. This work describes a series of incremental algorithms that are shown empirically to produce more accurate classification models than the batch algorithms in the presence of a concept drift while being computationally cheaper than existing incremental methods. The proposed incremental algorithms are based on an advanced decision-tree learning methodology called ``Info-Fuzzy Network'' (IFN), which is capable to induce compact and accurate classification models. The algorithms are evaluated on real-world streams of traffic and intrusion-detection data.},\n  number = {4},\n  journaltitle = {Applied Soft Computing},\n  shortjournal = {Appl.

Over the last few years, traffic data have been exploding, and we have truly entered the era of big data for transportation.

This situation inspires us to rethink the traffic flow prediction problem based on deep architecture models with big traffic data. In this paper, a novel deep-learning-based traffic flow prediction method is proposed, which considers the spatial and temporal correlations inherently. A stacked autoencoder model is used to learn generic traffic flow features, and it is trained in a greedy layerwise fashion. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a deep architecture model is applied using autoencoders as building blocks to represent traffic flow features for prediction.

Underlying the formation of norms is the ubiquitous belief that there is a correct response for every situation and an abiding interest for persons to base their responses on these correct foundations. Given such a belief, a normative evaluation of a feeling, thought or action is likely to arise when persons perceive that their positive or negative attitudinal evaluation is shared by one or more influential others. If interpersonal agreements validate attitudes and transform attitudes into norms, then the development of a theory of norm formation may draw on extant ``combinatorial'' theories of consensus production that describe how shared attitudes are produced and maintained in groups. The network theory of social influence that I employ is one such combinatorial approach. An important sociological implication of this network theory is that the content of norms must be consistent with the social stratification (or more general pattern of inequality) of interpersonal influences in a group. I illustrate the theory with an analysis of Roethlisberger and Dickson's (1939) classic observations on the Bank Wiring Observation Room.},\n  number = {3},\n  journaltitle = {Social Networks},\n  shortjournal = {Social Networks},\n  urldate = {2018-12-20},\n  date = {2001-07-01},\n  pages = {167-189},\n  keywords = {‚ÄúCombinatorial‚Äù theories,Anderson‚Äôs weighted averaging model,Bank Wiring Observation Room},\n  author = {Friedkin, Noah E.},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Latex/res/storage/KMWGKMAD/Friedkin_2001_Norm formation in social influence networks.pdf;/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Latex/res/storage/BNPZHC4M/S0378873301000363.html},\n  note = {00223}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578767748,"version":0},"$loki":337},{"itemID":3420,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{ren_survey_2015,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {A Survey of Recommendation Techniques Based on Offline Data Processing: {{A SURVEY OF RECOMMENDATION TECHNIQUES BASED ON OFFLINE DATA PROCESSING}}},\n  volume = {27},\n  issn = {15320626},\n  url = {http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/cpe.3370},\n  doi = {10.1002/cpe.3370},\n  shorttitle = {A Survey of Recommendation Techniques Based on Offline Data Processing},\n  number = {15},\n  journaltitle = {Concurrency and Computation: Practice and Experience},\n  shortjournal = {Concurr.

Crowdsourcing network coverage combined with crowdfunding costs can create sustainable yet decentralized Internet access infrastructures, where every participant can invest in resources, and pay and be paid for usage. While mesh networks and mesh routing protocols enable self-organized networks that expand organically, cryptocurrencies and smart contracts enable the economic coordination among network providers and consumers.

In this paper, we analyze the flexibility of LoRa and propose various strategies to adapt its radio parameters (such as the spreading factor, bandwidth, and transmission power) to different deployment scenarios. We compute the energy consumption of LoRa transceivers using various radio configurations in both star and mesh topologies. Our simulation results show that in a star topology, we can achieve the optimal scaling-up/down strategy of LoRa radio parameters to obtain either a high data rate or a long range while respecting low energy consumption. In mesh networks, energy consumption is optimized by exploiting various radio configurations and the network topology (e.g., the number of hops, the network density, the cell coverage). Finally, we propose a strategy to take advantage of both star and mesh topologies.},\n  eventtitle = {2017 {{IEEE}} 13th {{International Conference}} on {{Wireless}} and {{Mobile Computing}}, {{Networking}} and {{Communications}} ({{WiMob}})},\n  booktitle = {2017 {{IEEE}} 13th {{International Conference}} on {{Wireless}} and {{Mobile Computing}}, {{Networking}} and {{Communications}} ({{WiMob}})},\n  publisher = {{IEEE}},\n  urldate = {2019-01-19},\n  date = {2017-10},\n  pages = {1-8},\n  author = {Ochoa, Moises Nunez and Guizar, Arturo and Maman, Mickael and Duda, Andrzej},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Latex/res/storage/IAAQ2PAE/Ochoa et al. - 2017 - Evaluating LoRa energy efficiency for adaptive net.pdf},\n  note = {00014}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578768046,"version":0},"$loki":350},{"itemID":3461,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{farooq_operating_2011,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Operating {{Systems}} for {{Wireless Sensor Networks}}: {{A Survey}}},\n  volume = {11},\n  issn = {1424-8220},\n  url = {http://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/11/6/5900},\n  doi = {10.3390/s110605900},\n  shorttitle = {Operating {{Systems}} for {{Wireless Sensor Networks}}},\n  number = {6},\n  journaltitle = {Sensors},\n  urldate = {2019-01-19},\n  date = {2011-05-31},\n  pages = {5900-5930},\n  author = {Farooq, Muhammad Omer and Kunz, Thomas},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Latex/res/storage/6E6T6QJ5/Farooq_Kunz_2011_Operating Systems for Wireless Sensor Networks.pdf},\n  note = {00208}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1549578768060,"version":0},"$loki":351},{"itemID":3463,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{amjad_tinyosnew_2016,\n  title = {{{TinyOS}}-{{New Trends}}, {{Comparative Views}}, and {{Supported Sensing Applications}}: {{A Review}}},\n  volume = {16},\n  issn = {1530-437X, 1558-1748, 2379-9153},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7387670/},\n  doi = {10.1109/JSEN.2016.2519924},\n  shorttitle = {{{TinyOS}}-{{New Trends}}, {{Comparative Views}}, and {{Supported Sensing Applications}}},\n  number = {9},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Sensors Journal},\n  shortjournal = {IEEE Sens.
