-----DEX CORE-----------------------------------------
 
DEX CORE
 
Name:
    DEX CORE (LET)
 
Type:
    Let Subcommand
 
Purpose:
    This is a utility command used by the EST.DP macro for the analysis
    of 2-level full or fractional factorial design.
 
Description:
    The DEX10STEPANALYSIS.DP macro can be used to analyze 2-level full
    or fractional factorial designs.


    For 2-level full or fractional factorial design, the low level is
    typically coded as "-1" and the upper level is typically coded as
    "+1".  Center points are typically coded as "0".  This command
    checks whether each of the listed factor variables contains only
    "-1", "+1" and "0" values.

    If the factor variables are in the original units rather than coded
    as -1 and +1, you can use the CODE DEX command to convert them to
    -1 and +1 values.

Syntax:
    LET <iflag> = DEX CHECK CLASSIC  <name1> <name2> ... <namek>
    where <name1> <name2> ... <namek> is a list of 1 to k variable names;
    and   <iflag> is a parameter where the status is saved.
 
    If all variable names contain only -1, +1, or 0, <iflag> will be set
    to 1.  Otherwise <iflag> will be set to 0.

Examples:
    LET IFLAG = CHECK NAMES X1 X2 X3
    LET IFLAG = CHECK NAMES X1 X2 X3 X4 X5

Default:
    None
 
Synonyms:

    CHECK TYPES         = Check the types for a list of names.
    CHECK EQUAL LENGTH  = Check whether a list of variables have the same
                          number of elements.

-----DEX CONTOUR PLOT-----------------------------------------------
 
DEX CONTOUR PLOT
 
Name:
    DEX CONTOUR PLOT
 
Type:
    Graphics Command
 
Purpose:
    Generates a linear dex contour plot.
 
Description:
    A contour plot is a graphical technique for representing a
    3-dimensional z = f(x,y) surface by plotting constant-z "slices"
    (contours) on a 2-dimensional format.

    The dex contour plot is a specialized contour plot used in the
    design of experiments..  It is used in the case where you have
    two independent factors, each with two levels.  The
    low level is coded as "-1" and the high level is coded as
    "+1".  In addition, you can optionally have center points
    (center points are coded as "0" and represent the value
    of the independent variable halfway between the low level and
    high level of that variable).  These types of designs are
    common for full and fractional factorial designs.
    The dex contour plot is typically generated for the two
    most important factors in the full or fractional factorial
    design.  The determination of exactly which are the two
    most important factors is determined prior to generating
    the dex contour plot (e.g., through the use of dex mean
    plots).

    The typical application of the dex contour plot is in
    determining settings that will maximize (or minimize) the
    response variable.  It can also be helpful in determining
    settings that result in the response variable hitting a
    pre-determined target value.
