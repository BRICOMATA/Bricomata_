1: Sample Size                           = 500
 
2: Location
   Mean                                  = 0.507830436
   Standard Deviation of Mean            = 0.013162624927
   95% Confidence Interval for Mean      = (0.481969439757,0.533691432243)
   Drift with respect to location?       = NO
 
3: Variation
   Standard Deviation                    = 0.29432524099
   95% Confidence Interval for SD        = (0.27714355886,0.313795346744)
   Drift with respect to variation?
   (based on Levene's test on quarters
   of the data)                          = NO
 
4: Distribution
   Normal PPCC                           = 0.999568336816
   Data are Normal?
     (as measured by Normal PPCC)        = NO
 
   Uniform PPCC                          = 0.9995
   Data are Uniform?
     (as measured by Uniform PPCC)       = YES
 
5: Randomness
   Autocorrelation                       = -0.03098568913
   Data are Random?
     (as measured by autocorrelation)    = YES
 
6: Statistical Control
   (i.e., no drift in location or scale,
   data is random, distribution is 
   fixed, here we are testing only for
   fixed uniform)
   Data Set is in Statistical Control?   = YES
